<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> summer is here!—here with its fragrant
mornings and its noonday heats, its mellow twilights
and its moonlight evenings, its days of glory and its
nights of starry beauty. It is summer. Let us go
out into the country, away from the stifling air and
dull brick walls of the town, into the far, pure,
breezy, unsurpassable country. There we shall
breathe the fresh air of Heaven. We will lie down
on some shady knoll; or stretch ourselves beside the
cooling stream; or wander off among the breezy
woods; or perchance sit in some quiet arbor of the
garden, listening to the low humming of the bees, or
the far-off tinkle of the brooklet on the stones. Ay!
we will go out into the country. We will gaze on
the green grass, the growing flowers, the cloudless
azure of the skies. But we will do more. We will
gaze on our fellow man such as God made him, and
not on the too often mean, grovelling and short-sighted
denizens of the town. We will go out into the
country. We will go into its stately palaces, secluded
among sombre trees; into the airy, fantastic
dwellings of retired citizens; into sunny old farm-houses,
with their wide porches inviting us to enter;
and—oftener than all—into the smiling cottages,
which, peeping out from amid overspreading honeysuckles,
dozing under willow trees by the brook-side,
or nestling beneath the shadow of a green and fragrant
hill, are scattered all over the land, in hill and
in dell, studding it, as it were, with loveliness. And
wherever we go we shall still find beauty. God hath
left his impress on the green fields and running
brooks, and every leaf that quivers in the breeze,
and every bird that carols on the air, speak out His
praise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are in the country; and yonder is a cottage
nestled close under the hill-side, like a dove in the
bosom of a young and innocent girl. Hear you not
the brook, low pattering before its door; that brook
which at eve and morning, ay! in the still watches
of the night, may be heard murmuring mysteriously,
as if it were angels’ voices conversing on the quiet
air? Let us go into that cottage. There are flowers
before the house and honeysuckles around the door,
and everything, even to the garden flags, is white-washed.
There are roses under the window—how
fragrant! And yet the owner of that little tenement
has a hand horny with labor, and not a day passes,
summer or winter, but that he is up before dawn,
toiling for his richer neighbor. How does he live?
Would you know what cottage life is? Come with
us, then, into the fields, and let us sit together by this
brawling brook, while we recount the history of a
cottage life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All over this land there are spots like this, of bewildering
beauty; where toil and rest, and wo and
happiness, have struggled together for years. There
are thousands, ay! tens of thousands, of humble cottages,
the lives of whose inmates have never won a
thought from the rich and proud, and yet in those
cottages beat as true hearts as in the most gorgeous
mansions of the realm. The rich are born, and great
is the rejoicing thereat; they live, and crowds shout
triumphs wherever they go; they die, and they are
laid by obsequious hands in proud mausoleums; but
the poor come and go like the leaves of the forest,
and no man careth for their fate. Their childhood of
early toil; their youth of premature sorrow; their
lives of hard, unyielding, grinding poverty, what
does the world care for these? Yet the poor are not
without comfort. They have within their own circle
as kindly bosoms as the rich; they have dear ones,
loved with a fervor wealth can rarely win, to cheer
them in distress; they have a fireside, humble, indeed,
but still a fireside around which to gather with
their prattlers, and smile and be merry after the toils
of the day are done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With early dawn the cottager is up and afield. If
he labors at the soil, you will find him with the
plough in hand, keeping his monotonous track to and
fro, regardless, apparently, of the stifled air, or the
sultry rays of noon-day. He may pause an hour or
so at dinner, but he is soon at his labor again. The
cattle may be dozing under the trees, the birds may
be carolling gaily around, the woods, and streams,
and all nature may be full of merry play, but still he
must keep up his weary toil, until twilight at length
releases him, and he hurries home to spend a few
hours of fleeting happiness among his little ones,
to sleep, and again to resume his toil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there is a bright side to the picture. The Cottager
was not always a man, he was once a happy
child, and in gazing on the frolicks of his little ones,
his own youth appears to be renewed. And where
do the domestic affections exist with more purity
than in our cottages? From the love of a child for its
little brother or its sister, up to the love of a mother
for her first-born, there is nothing purer, deeper, or
more enduring than the affections of those who inhabit
our cottages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We see now two beings at that cottage door, a
mother and her boy. The child hath fallen asleep
upon her lap, and he reposes with a grace so careless,
and there is such an innocent joy upon his face, that
one cannot but feel that he is supremely happy. How
he nestles on that mother’s knee. The vine that
gaily winds around the gentle sapling, or hangs so
airily over the little group, is not more beautiful than
he. And she!—is not the book held to shade his
countenance, and the holy, contemplative emotions
which light up her face as with the divinity of an
angel, beyond comparison, ay! almost beyond imagination.
God be thanked that there are thousands
all over this broad land as happy as they!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sunday is the time for cottage life. Then the new
coat is taken out, carefully brushed, and put on—the
little ones are clad in their tidy, well-kept Sabbath
clothes—and the good house-wife attires herself in
her best, adding, often, some little piece of finery,
which a month’s savings have tempted her to buy.
Directly the bell is heard calling them to church.
Away at the signal they go, with a quiet decorum
even in the children; and soon they meet others trooping
over the hills to the white-steepled meeting house
in the glen. And when the sermon is over, and they
pass out of the house of God, there are greetings
among neighbors, inquiries after old friends, and perchance
here and there long conversations betwixt
good house-wives, which seem like the fairy’s dream,
never to come to an end. And in the afternoon some
one is sure to drop in, when the best tea-cups are
brought out from the corner cupboard, and the best
hot cakes, and such tempting coffee are prepared by
the good dame, that your mouth fairly waters until
you have tasted thereof. And how merry all are—not
with a boisterous mirth, but with a calm happiness,
reminding you continually of the day. And all
this time the children are playing on the lawn, or
gathering buttercups to hold under each others chins,
or laughing in their own innocent way so joyously,
that their mothers will pause awhile, and look on
them and smile. And by and by night will come,
and the company will depart, and so, after reading a
chapter of the bible, the cottagers will go to bed.
Though the stars, on a Sabbath night, look down on
many a quiet, happy home, they smile on none where
there is more happiness than there. And such is
<span class='sc'>Cottage Life</span>.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A LEGEND OF THE COMMONWEALTH.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “THE BROTHERS,” “CROMWELL,” “RINGWOOD THE ROVER,” ETC.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a glorious day in Rome; the unclouded sun
was blazing in the clear azure of a deep Italian sky,
filling the universal air with life and lustre; the
summer winds were all abroad, crisping the bosom
of the yellow Tiber into ten thousand tiny rivulets,
tossing ten thousand dewy odors from their wings,
and bearing with them, far and near, the myriad
harmonies of nature. It was a day of revelry, of
loud exulting mirth, of gratified ambition to the
one, of haughty triumph to the million.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in truth a day of triumph. Marius, the
people’s idol, the great plebeian conqueror, had
brought the army home—the army, long foiled and
often beaten on the parched sands of the Zahara, or
by the scanty streams of the Bagradas and Mulucha—had
brought the army home, scar-seamed and
wearied and war-worn, but glorious and elated and
triumphant; for with them came a chained, indignant
captive, the bravest, fiercest, wisest of all the
kings who yet had dared to strive against the unconquered
majesty of the Republic: the murderer, the
fratricide Jugurtha; he who had mocked the justice,
and with success defied the brazen legions and the
superb commanders of Rome’s resistless warfare;
he who had driven out from his Numidian confines,
whether by force or fraud, two several consular armies,
sent one, degraded and debased forever, beneath
the ignominious yoke, and for long years possessed
his blood-bought throne in spite of all the
efforts of his tremendous rival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, therefore, was the day of retribution, and all
the fiery passions of the Italian heart were at work
hotly in the crowd that thronged the thoroughfares
of the great city on that auspicious morning. Well
might they throng the streets, for never, from that
day to this, has aught of pomp or pageant been invented
that could sustain comparison one moment
with the unequalled splendors of a Roman triumph.
The whole line of proud streets, up from the field of
Mars to the Capitoline, was strewn with carpets of
the rich Tyrian crimson; cartloads of flowers—rose,
violet, narcissus, hyacinth—were scattered everywhere,
to send their perfumes forth beneath the
trampling feet of the triumphant legions. The walls
of every house and palace were hung with glowing
tapestries, with waving flags, and laurel-woven garlands.
From every shrine and chapel, hundreds of
which were there sacred to one or other of Rome’s
hundred deities, sang forth the melody of sacrificial
hymns, and streamed the breath of incense. The
sun had reached the summit of his ascending course,
when from the distant campus arose at once the din,
piercing the ears and thrilling as it were to the very
soul, of the great sacred trumpets, and the earth-shaking
shout of Rome’s vast population; then on
they came—a long and dazzling line of splendor—three
hundred snow-white steers, unblemished and
majestic, the far-famed breed of the Clitunnus, led
the van, with gilded horns, and fluttering fillets of
bright hues about their ample fronts, led by as many
youths in sacrificial tunics of pure white; then came
the bands of music, trumpet and horn and clarion,
and the quick clashing cymbal blent with the deep
bass of the Phrygian drum; and then the Flamens of
the gods, in the appropriate and gorgeous dresses;
the great Dialis, with his red tuft and snow-white
robes; the Salian priests of Mars, with brazen helms
and corselets and flowery tunics girded up, and on
their arms the sacred shields of Numa; the vestals,
stoled and veiled and silent, and the mad ministers
of Cybele, with their strange instruments of music,
leaping and dancing with strange gestures, and
waking all the echoes with their barbaric hymnings.
After these stately and revered, and almost divine
personages, trooped on—strange contrast—a band
of mimics and jesters, buffoons with scurrilous songs
and obscene gestures, calling forth from the mob of
Rome many a plaudit by their licentious wit. Then,
with perfumes and steaming censers, scattering
bunches of the choicest flowers, all in their purple
bordered tunics, with golden balls about their necks,
barefooted and bareheaded, the sons of the Patricians
passed, the prime of Rome’s young aristocracy.
Other musicians followed, and then, caparisoned for
war, with castles on their backs and gorgeous
housings on their unwieldy carcasses, each driven by
a coal-black Ethiopian astride on his huge neck, the
captured elephants—an hundred mighty monsters,
the like of which had never before gladdened the
eyes of the amazed and wonder-stricken populace.
Next rolled the wains, slow dragged by snow-white
oxen, groaning beneath the weight of the rich spoils
of the Numidian empire—armor of gold and silver,
weapons thick set with emeralds and diamonds,
statues and jars and vases of pure gold—dazzling
the eyes and bewildering the senses with their unequalled
splendor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hark! what a roar, a thunder of applause! It
is—it is—<span class='sc'>Io triumphe, Io pæan</span>, it is the mighty
Marius! Aloft he stood—aloft in more than regal
pomp, in more than mortal glory. The car was
ivory and gold, embossed and carved with rare device,
drawn by six steeds abreast, white as the
driven snow, with manes and tails that literally
swept the ground, housed with rich crimson trappings,
harnessed and reined with gold. But what
were ivory or gold, or what the choicest specimens
of mere brute beauty, to the sublime and glorious
figure of the triumphant general? Tall, powerful,
broad shouldered and strong limbed, as he stood
there clad in the tunic and toga of fine crimson, all
woven over with palm branches of gold, wearing the
laurel crown upon his coal-black locks, and holding
in his right hand the ivory sceptre, and in his left a
branch of green triumphal bay, he looked the emblem,
the very incarnation and ideal of Rome’s undaunted
energy. His hair, black as the raven’s
wing, was curled in short crisp locks close to his
finely formed head and expansive temples; his nose
was high, keen, aquiline; his eyes bright as the
eagle’s, and, like his, formed as it were to gaze into
the very focus of the sun’s beams, and pierce the
dunnest war clouds with all-pervading vision; his
lips were thin, firm and compressed, with that set
iron curve which gives the strongest token of indomitable
resolution. Swarthy almost to negro blackness,
gloomy and lowering was his brow, and furrowed
by deep lines of care and passion—yet was there
naught that savored in the least of cruelty or even of
suspicion in the bold, daring features—pride there
was evident in every glance, in every gesture, and
fiery courage, and stern constancy; but nothing
jealous or tyrannical, much less bloodthirsty or vindictive.
Yet this was he who in after years let slip
the dogs of Hell against the sons of his own mother
Rome, who deluged her fair streets with oceans of
Patrician gore, and made her shrines and palaces,
her stateliest temples and her lowliest dwellings,
one mighty human shambles. But now he was all
gratified ambition, proud courtesy and high anticipation;
yet he bowed not nor smiled at the reiterated
clamors of the mighty concourse, nor waved his
laurelled sceptre to and fro, but held his proud head
high and heavenward, and kept his dark eye fixed on
vacancy, as though he would pierce onward—onward—through
space and time, far off into the secrets
of futurity, with consulships and censorships
and triumphs, provinces, armies, honors, <span class='sc'>Fame</span>,
thronging before his footsteps, and still beckoning
him forward. Behind him stood a slave, such was
the order, the immemorial order, of the triumphal
rite, who ever and anon, as louder pealed the acclamations
of the mob, and wilder waxed the din of
gratulation, leaned forward, whispering in his ear,
“Remember, Marius, remember that thou art a man!”
for so sublime, so godlike, was that station deemed,
that the stern fathers of the young Republic had
judged such warning needful to curb the vaultings of
that pride which might believe itself immortal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind the chariot wheels stalked one, alas! how
far removed from the haught victor, the royal Moor,
Rome’s deadliest foe, Jugurtha. He, as his conqueror,
was tall, and of a bearing that had been soldierly
at once and royal—yet he was not, though vigorously
strong and very active, of a frame nearly so superb
or massive as the great Roman—lithe, sinewy
and muscular, he showed all the distinctive marks
characteristic of his race; his face was handsome—the
features at least eminently so—of a clear, sunny
olive hue, through which the blood would gleam at
times, when passion drove its currents, boiling like
molten lava, through every vein and artery: but now
it was as cold and pallid as though he had already
passed the portals of the grave. His eyes, like those
of Marius, glared forward into the vacant air; but
not like his was his mind bent forward. Back!
back!—long years of retrospection—to the bright,
happy days of youth, when he and his two murdered
cousins sported together, before the fell and fiendish
lust of empire had turned their blood to gall; to the
young promise of his glorious manhood, when, side
by side with Scipio, he strove before the bulwarks of
Numantia: when he was praised and honored of that
great commander in the full presence of a Roman
host; and, later still, to his proud aspirations after
thrones, to his triumphant usurpation, his undoubted
sway over the glowing hearts and tameless energies
of the free, wild Numidians; and, later yet, to fields
of furious warfare, to midnight marches over the
lone sands of the desert, dark ambuscades near to
some long sought river, skirmishes, onslaughts, victories—aye!
victories won from the Roman. His
scarlet turban, decked with the tall tiara peculiar to
the royal race, still gleamed as if in mockery above
his ashy brow; his caftan, gleaming with fringes and
embroideries of gold, girded with costly shawls,
from which still hung his gold sheathed and gold
hilted scimetar; his wide and flowing robe of fine
white woollen stuff, so fine and gauze-like in its texture
that all the gorgeous hues of his under-dress
were visible, though mellowed in their tints, beneath
it; his necklace of the richest gems, armlets and
bracelets, and long pendants in his ears of the most
precious rubies, all spoke the Prince—the King!
But lo! beside the bracelets upon those swarthy
arms, the galling manacles of steel, and on the
sinewy ancles, clasping the jewelled sandals with
their stern circles, the fetters of the captive—of the
slave! They clanked—they clanked at every stride,
those fearful emblems, and still, as every ringing
clash announced the fallen state of their late dreaded
foe, the savage mob sent forth loud yells of mirth,
mingled with groans of execration! But he felt not
the fetters, nor marked the clanging din that harbingered
his footsteps, nor heard the hootings of the
rabble; he knew not that his sons, his two beloved
ones, were beside him, fettered and manacled as he,
their guilty sire; he saw not the procession nor the
pomp, nor knew that they but marshalled him to death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind this lamentable group stalked, two and
two, with their dread implements (the rod-bound
axes,) ready and glittering coldly in the sun, the
lictors; and behind these, on foot, and in his toga all
unadorned and simple, the consul colleague of the
triumphant chief; and after him the senate, renowned,
grave and wise—stately, sublime assemblage!
Then, with the din of martial music, and the loud
clash of brazen armor, their helmets all enwreathed
with branches of the bay tree, their banners and their
eagles entwined and over-canopied with laurel, on
swept the conquering army; each legion, with its
horse, its skirmishers, its engines, its legate and his
tribunes on their proud chargers, and its centurions
marching at the head each of his manipule, rolled
on—row after row of brass, solid, compact, immovable—a
vast machine of men, with but one voice, one
stride, one motion for ten thousand human beings.
“<span class='sc'>Io Triumphe! Io Pæan!</span> Ho! for the godlike
General! Ho! for the conquering army!” Such
was the pomp of Marius, but so closed not the line of
the procession, for every soul of Rome’s vast population
swelled it for miles in length; old tottering
grandsires, men in the prime of manhood, youths in
the flush of spring-time, boys, children, infants at the
breast, matrons and brides and maidens—all ranks,
all classes, all conditions—the proud, luxurious patrician,
the turbulent democracy, mechanics from the
suburbs and farmers from the colonies, and slaves
and freedmen, all thronged exultingly the via Sacra,
all swelled the shout for Marius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now they reached the capitol, and the great
leader slowly descended from his car, and, led by
pontifex and priest, mounted the hundred steps of
brass, and stood before the temple of Jupiter Capitoline,
the guardian god of the great city. Then
louder pealed the trumpets and the hymns, and incense
smoked up to the skies, veiling the very temple,
in its dense wreaths of snow, from those who
gazed up thither from the Forum. The prayers
were prayed, the offerings tendered to the god, the
victims slaughtered, the supplication and thanksgiving
ended. Then, in the temple of the god, the
Senate and the Consuls feasted, and the lord of that
high feast was Caius Marius. Wine flowed and golden
goblets clanged, and there was merriment and
revelry and joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And where was he—Jugurtha?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a place,”—we quote the words of his
historian—“there is a place in the prison which is
called the Tullianum, when you have ascended a little
way to the left hand, sunk about twelve feet under
ground. Walls surrounded it on every side, and a
vaulted roof above, compact with stone groinings;
but from its filth, its darkness, and its fœtid smell,
its appearance is alike terrible and loathsome.”
Such is the plain and unadorned description of a cell
yet existing; they call it now San Pietro in Carcere.
Thither the lictors bore Jugurtha; he spoke not at
all, nor seemed to understand or to see anything.
They stripped him of his gorgeous robes and rich
trappings with fierce, indecent haste; they snatched
the chains from round about his neck, the bracelets
from his arms; they tore the pendants from his ears,
and—for they might not spare the time to loose the
clasps—tore the tips of his ears away also! They
stripped him to the skin, yet he resisted not, nor
strove, nor struggled; they lowered him with ropes—him,
in his fetters—into that foul and ghastly cell,
and then a horrid smile flitted across his features—“This
bath of yours,” he said, “methinks is very
chilly!” He shuddered, was let down, alone—and
died there, as his crimes had merited!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>To</span> the stake with her! Away with the sorceress!
God’s curse be on her for her evil doings!”
shouted the mob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was early morning, yet even at that hour the
judgment hall of the little town of Bourdonnois was
thronged with the populace. Men, women and children,
old and young, the noble and the burgher,
priests, soldiers and common people, crowded the
spacious hall, and glared fiercely on the prisoner,
while ever and anon they muttered imprecations on
her, and cried madly for her blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening before, a female, closely veiled, and
attended by two servants, whose dark countenances
bespoke them sons of Ethiopia, had arrived at Bourdonnois,
and put up at one of the principal hostelries
of the place. Strange rumors soon arose respecting
her. Her garb, her mien, her language and her complexion
were said to be those of a Saracen, against
which accursed race the chivalry of Europe and the
church itself warred in vain. These rumors gained
additional strength when the landlord of the inn
where she had stopped was heard to say that he had
seen her practising sorcery, a charge easily credited
in that age, and one which few, especially in a case
like this, had the hardihood to disbelieve. In less
than an hour the whole population of the town was
afloat, surrounding the hostelry, and crying out for
vengeance against the sorceress. Such commotions
were both frequent and sanguinary in that superstitious
age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soldiery, however, interfered by arresting the
unsuspecting victim of these rumors, and at this
early hour the prisoner had been brought into the
judgment hall to await a mockery of trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Answer me, daughter of Belial!” said the judge,
as soon as the murmurs of the mob allowed him to
be heard. “Will you confess your crime? Speak,
or you die! Know you that the rack, aye! fire itself,
awaits you if your obstinacy continues?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prisoner was a slight girlish creature, sitting
with her face buried in her hands, directly opposite
to the judge. She was apparently young, and her
figure, so far as it could be seen through the thick
veil which shrouded her form, was light and agile as
that of a sylph. To the judge’s question she made
no answer. She only shook her head despondingly,
and those nigh her fancied they heard her sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the stake with the heathen sorceress! She
deals with the evil one!” shouted the mob. “What
need we further than this silence? Away with her—away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At these fearful words, repeated now for the second
time, and growled forth with an ominous fierceness,
appalling even to the hearer, the prisoner was observed
to tremble, whether with fear or otherwise
we know not, and lifting her veil up with a sudden
effort, she rose to her feet, turned hastily around to
the mob, and disclosed a countenance of such surpassing
loveliness to their gaze, that even those who
had cried out most unrelentingly for her blood now
shrank abashed into silence, while others, who had
been less eager for her condemnation, audibly murmured
in her favor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would ye have of me?” she said, addressing
the judge, and for the first time standing unveiled
before him. “As there is a God in whom we both
believe, I have told you only the truth. I am a
stranger, a foreigner, a defenceless woman, but not
the less the affianced bride of one of your proudest
nobles, the Count de Garonne.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tone in which she spoke was firm, but oh!
how touchingly sweet; and her words were uttered
in broken French, with a perceptible Oriental accent.
Loud murmurs arose in her favor as she ceased
speaking. The tide was turning. But the judge
now spoke:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out on thee, woman of hell! Out on thee for a
base slanderer of a noble of France, and a holy crusader!
Thou the betrothed bride of Garonne! As
soon would the eagle mate with the vulture. I tell
thee, woman, that thy story of having been shipwrecked
when coming to France, and of all thy train
having been lost except thy two Ethiopian myrmidons,
is a foul lie, and I am almost minded to wring
the truth from thee on the rack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have said it,” said the prisoner, in a firm voice,
for she felt her life depended on her calmness, “and
if you will give but one week, only one little week,
I will prove it before man as well as God. I came
from Syria in the same fleet with my lord, but under
charge of his mother’s confessor—now a saint in
Heaven!—but being separated by a storm, in which
our galley was shipwrecked, I was thrown unprotected
on your shores. I am a stranger here. My servants
even have deserted me. I do no one harm. I
plot no treason. All I ask is to pass on my way.
Oh!” she continued, with a burst of emotion, “if you
have a daughter, think what would be your feelings
if she was to be thus set upon in a strange land,” and
she burst into tears. Again the crowd murmured in
her favor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Woman!” sternly interposed the judge, unmoved
by her emotion, “look at the victim of your sorcery,
and seek no longer to deceive us by your lies. Stand
forth, Philip the Deformed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the words of the judge, an official bearing a
white wand stepped into a side room, and in a moment
reappeared with a cripple hideously deformed,
whom the populace recognised as the landlord of the
hostelry. When confronted with the prisoner, he
glared on her with a look of demoniac hatred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know you this woman?” asked the judge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay! to my cost,” answered the cripple. “It is
through her incantations that I am the being I am.
It was but yesterday she came to my inn, attended
by two heathenish Ethiopians, whom I have heard
palmers from the holy land say are kept by the Paynims—God’s
ban be theirs! I no sooner beheld her
than I recognised her to be the sorceress who, three
years ago, brought on me the disease by which I am
crippled. I could tell her among a thousand. The
curse of God light on her for a child of the evil one,”
and the witness ground his teeth together, and glared
fiercely at the prisoner. A low murmur of approval,
at first faint and whispered, but gradually swelling
into a confused shout, rose on the ear as he ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a perjured wretch,” exclaimed the prisoner,
with energy, “whom my servants detected in an attempt
to rob my poor effects; hence his malice and
this charge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence, woman!” sternly interposed the judge,
“or else confess. Will you, a child of Belial, malign
a Christian man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The testimony of the publican had worked a complete
change in the fluctuating feelings of the mob
towards the prisoner, and the words of the judge
were answered back by a shout of approval. The
prisoner was seen to turn deathly pale. She did not
reply, however, to the question, but shook her head
despondingly, as if conscious that all hope was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lead her away,” hoarsely growled the mob,
while the dense mass of people swayed to and fro in
the excitement, as if they would have rushed on the
defenceless victim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Again I ask thee, woman, wilt thou confess?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head despondingly, buried her face
in her hands, and murmured something; perhaps it
was a prayer. The mob burst once more into commotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are the servants of this woman?—let
them be put on the rack,” said the judge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have escaped,” answered an official.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Escaped!” said the judge, “ha! were they
living men, or the servants of the foul fiend? Know
you aught?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do know,” said the maiden, suddenly rising to
her feet, and speaking with the energy of a queen,
while her eye flashed and her bosom heaved with excitement,
“and thank God that they are free, although
they have left me defenceless. Yes! they are
free from your tortures. Me, you may murder with
your accursed laws, but—mark me—I shall be fearfully
avenged. My story has been truly told—so
help me God”—and she raised her eyes to Heaven
in adjuration, “and if I die, I die innocent. I tell
ye I am the betrothed bride of a noble. I am more;
I am the daughter of a prince. And now do your
worst. I shall die worthy of my race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat down. Not a murmur was heard for the
space of a minute after she had ceased. Her daring
energy awe-struck all. But what could even bravery
like hers effect against a brutal, bigot populace?
As soon as the hearers could recover from their
momentary consternation, they broke into a whirlwind
of shouts and imprecations, and rushed on to the
defenceless girl; and had not the soldiery, who immediately
guarded her, interposed, she would have
fallen an instant victim to the rage of the populace.
To be torn in pieces by a mob was a death too horrible!
She turned imploringly to the judge, but there
was no hope in his iron face. She closed her eyes,
but the howling mob still swam before her vision;
and when she buried her face in her robe, and strove
to shut out their imprecations, their fierce, wild cries
still rung in her ears. At each moment the tumult
deepened, until the excitement of the populace became
uncontrollable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Away with her—she is sold to the fiend—away—away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vengeance for the sufferers by her incantations!”
hoarsely growled a voice from the mob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The judge no longer hesitated, but yielding to the
popular current as well as his own prejudices, sentenced
her to be burned at high noon of that very day.
A wild shout of exultation rose from the frenzied
mob as the sentence was pronounced, but over all the
din swelled the fearful cry, “To the stake with her—away
with the sorceress.” Such was justice in that
age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a few hours earlier in the same day when a
noble knight sat in a hostelry of the little seaport
town of ——. He was of a singularly imposing
cast of countenance. His features were of the true
Norman outline, with a lofty intellectual brow,
shaded by locks of the richest chesnut hue. His
cheek was embrowned by a Syrian sun until it was of
the darkest olive color, but the clear white of his
forehead, which had been protected from exposure by
his helmet, betrayed the original purity of his complexion.
He had an eye whose glance can only be
likened to that of an eagle. His form was tall and
commanding. He sat apparently absorbed in thought,
but was aroused from his reverie by the entrance of a
retainer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are the horses ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my lord,” said the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will mount into the saddle at once then; how
far did they say it was to Bourdonnois?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Six leagues.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall reach it before nightfall; lead on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party which set forth from the inn was a gallant
sight to behold. Knights, squires, men-at-arms
and other retainers swelled the escort of the young
Count to the number of nearly four-score, while the
pennons waving on the air, and the occasional sound
of a trumpet, gave a liveliness to the escort which
attracted the attention of the passer by, of every rank
and sex, and drew many a sigh of envy from them.
But who might pretend to be the equal of the renowned
Count Garonne, a crusader of untarnished
fame, a gallant still in the flower of his youth, and
the lord of half a score of castles scattered over the
wide domain of France?</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the head of the proud array rode the Count himself,
conversing gaily with a knight at his side, whom
he familiarly called cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, by St. Denis!” said the Count, “she is a
divinity such as even our sunny Provence doth not
afford. Such eyes, such hair, and then, by my faith,
such a voice! It pained my heart to part from my
sweet Zillah—but she would have it so—and so she
comes in company with father Ambrose and a score
of my best knights. Her maidenly modesty dictated
this, and I was forced to submit. We were separated,
however, by that heathenish storm, and I suppose
her galley put into Genoa. You know she will
be given away by none but the Holy Father himself,”
and the glad lover reined his horse, while the animal,
as if partaking of its master’s joy, curvetted gaily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I long to see your princess, nor do I wonder at
your love, since she freed you from a Moslem prison;
when shall I greet my future cousin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall reach Bourdonnois to-night, and to-morrow—let
me see—to-morrow we shall keep on
to Trouchet; in another day we shall arrive at Genoa,
and there we will await her, if her galley is not
already arrived.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am all impatience to behold her—but look at
the knave coming over yonder hill. He rides like the
fiend himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay! and by St. Denis he is a blackamoor, a
scarcer thing here than in Syria. Holy Father, how
he dashes on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even while they spoke the horseman rapidly approached,
and, before many minutes, drew in the
rein of his foaming steed at the side of the Count,
whom he appeared to know. The recognition was
mutual. The man instantly spoke in a strange
tongue, and with violent gestures, while, with an
agitated voice, the Count appeared to question him.
But a few minutes had elapsed, however, before the
Count turned around to his cousin, and exclaimed, in
a voice trembling with emotion, but with an attempt
at composure,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zillah has been wrecked, and only she and two of
her train, with a few common sailors, have escaped.
Her strange companions, her foreign tongue, but,
more than all, the accursed perjuries of a thieving
innkeeper, have brought on her the charge of sorcery,
a tumult has been raised, she has been arrested,
and—God of my fathers!—may even now be suffering
on the rack or at the stake. Oh! why did I ever
submit to leave her? But, by the mother of God! if
a hair of her head is harmed, I will hang every knave
of Bourdonnois.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us on at once, then; we may yet arrive in
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pass the word down the line,” exclaimed the
Count. “On, knights and gentlemen; we must not
draw rein until we reach Bourdonnois.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a few minutes of hurried consultation with
the servant, who stated that he and his fellow had
escaped in the height of the tumult, and each, by different
roads, sought the port where they supposed
the Count to be, the gallant array set forward at a
rapid pace, and in a few moments nothing but a cloud
of dust in the valley and on the hill-side was left to
tell of their late presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was already high noon in Bourdonnois. A little
out of the town, in a gentle valley, was the place
chosen for the infliction of the horrid sentence. For
more than an hour—indeed ever since the condemnation
of the accused—the populace had been pouring
thither in crowds, until now a vast multitude, comprising
nearly the whole population of the town, surrounded
the place of execution, and covered the encircling
hills, like spectators in an amphitheatre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the procession came in sight. First
marched a body of soldiery; then followed the magistrates
of the town; directly after appeared several
monks; and then, clad in white, with her pale face
bent on the ground, and her hands tightly pressed together,
came the victim. She made no answer, it
was observed, to the words of the monks on either
hand, but ever and anon she would kiss a crucifix
which she carried, and raise her swimming eyes to
Heaven. In that hour of bitterest agony, what
must have been her emotions? She, the daughter of
an Emir, and the affianced bride of one of the proudest
nobles of France, to be hissed at by a mob, and
end her life in unheard-of torments at the stake! Oh!
if her lover, she thought, only knew of her peril!
But alas! he was far away. Well might she raise
her streaming eyes to Heaven as to her only hope,
and well might she turn away from the ministers of
religion who sanctioned her sacrifice, and trust only
in that cross which was her lover’s gift, and the emblem
of the sufferings of one whom that lover had
taught her was the only true God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” she murmured to herself, “if Henri only
knew my peril, he would yet rescue me. But there
is no hope; and I must not forget that I am the
daughter of a warrior. Henri shall hear that I died
as became his affianced bride;” and her figure seemed
to dilate and her walk to grow more majestic as she
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length they reached the fatal stake. But if
Zillah shuddered at its sight, the feeling was checked
before it could be seen by the populace. Calm and
collected, though pale as the driven snow, she stood
proudly up while the fatal chain was affixed around
her slender waist, and, with eyes upraised to Heaven,
appeared to be only an indifferent spectator, instead
of the chief person in the fatal tragedy. Not a repining
word broke from her lips. The first agony of
death had passed away, and she had steeled her
heart to her fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length all was prepared. Over the vast assembly
gazing on her, hung the silence of the dead.
Men’s breaths came quick, and their hearts fluttered
when they felt that in another minute the awful tragedy
would be begun. Every eye was bent intently on
the fatal stake as the executioner approached with
the fiery brand. For the last time, Zillah opened her
eyes to take a final look on that earth to which she
was soon to bid farewell forever. But what sent that
sudden flush to her cheek? Why that cry of thrilling
joy, the first audible sound which had left her
lips since her sentence? She sees a troop of fiery
horsemen, covered with dust and foam, thundering
over the brow of the hill in front of her,
and in the very van of the array she recognizes the
pennon of the Count of Garonne, waving in the noonday
sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Onward came the rescuers. Horse on horse, knight
after knight, retainer following retainer, they swept
like a whirlwind down the hill, shouting their war-cry,
“Garonne—a St. Denis and Garonne!” the
panic-struck crowd opening to the right and to the
left before them. In vain the soldiery who guarded
the victim attempted to resist the rush of the assailants.
They might as well have withstood the ocean
surges in their might. The shock of the horsemen
was irresistible. Foremost among them, cleaving his
way like a giant, rode the Count himself, his tall
figure and powerful charger rendering him conspicuous
over all. Nothing could resist him. He seemed
like an avenging spirit come to the aid of the suffering
victim, nor were those wanting who saw in the
sudden appearance of the rescuers, and their indomitable
courage, proofs of supernatural agency. A universal
panic seized on the crowd. Soldiers as well as
populace broke and fled. In a few minutes the Count
had gained the stake, when, springing from his steed,
he rushed forward, and, with one blow of his huge
sword, had severed the chain which bound the victim
to the stake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Henri!” hysterically said the rescued girl,
as she sprang forward and fell fainting into her
lover’s arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zillah! God be praised that you are safe. Curses
on the villains. She faints. Ho, there! water, you
knaves, or I cleave you to the chine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the maiden had only fainted from excess of
joy, and when restoratives were applied, she speedily
recovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our story is done. The terror of the populace; the
humble apologies of the magistracy; the merited
punishment of the perjured publican; and the speedy
union of the Count and the converted princess—are
they not all written in the chronicles of the noble
house of Garonne?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Mary</span>!” said the low voice of Henry Ashton.
The maiden looked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary! I have much to tell you—will you listen
to me awhile, only for a moment!” and he spoke fast
and eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A moment only, you say—well, I suppose I
must,—but what a beautiful butterfly is that. Oh!
the dear, sweet, tiny thing; do, pray, try and catch it
for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ashton was stung to the heart. He had been on
the point of declaring his long-cherished passion for
Mary Derwentwater, and he felt that she knew, not
only the depth of his affection, but that the words
trembling on his lips were an avowal of his love.
Her light-heartedness at once changed the whole current
of his feelings. Often had he heard others say
that his beautiful cousin was a coquette, and more
than once had she trifled with his own feelings. He
had hoped that her conduct was the result only of a
momentary whim, but this last act displayed a confirmed
heartlessness of which an hour before he would
not have deemed her capable. He sighed, and was
silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! dear, how ungallant you are,” continued
his cousin, “the beautiful creature will really escape,
and I do so love butterflies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is. I shall never forgive you. Don’t ask
me to,” said Mary affectedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we must part without it,” said Henry carelessly.
“I leave here to-morrow, and shall visit
Europe before I return. It may be years—it may be
forever that I shall be absent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—Harry—you jest,” said his companion,
struggling to appear composed, although she felt how
cold and pale her cheek had grown. “I never heard
of this before. You are not in earnest,” and she laid
her soft white hand—that hand, whose touch made
every nerve of Ashton thrill—on her lover’s arm,
looking up into his face with her dark, and now melting
eye. But the chord had been stretched until it
had snapped, and her influence over Ashton was gone.
He half averted his head, as he answered coldly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not jest, especially with a friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tone, the emphasis, the manner, all stung the
pride of Mary. She felt that his censure was just,
and yet she spurned it. Her hand fell from his arm,
and emulating his own coldness, she said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I will not ask you to stay. But as it is
late, and you will have your preparations to make, I
will not intrude on your time,” and curtesying, she
withdrew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this is the being in whom I had garnered up
all my heart’s best affections,” exclaimed Ashton,
when he found himself alone. “This the divinity I
have adored with a fervor no mortal bosom ever yet
felt, and she could talk, heartlessly talk of the
merest trifle, when she saw that my whole heart was
bound up in her. Oh! would we had never met. But
my delusion is over. I will fly. Mary! Mary! little
did I dream that my love would meet with such a
return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary hurried to her chamber, and locking the door,
she flung herself upon the bed, and burst into a flood
of tears. How bitterly she reproached herself that
her momentary coquetry had lost her the love of the
only being for whom she cared. She did not disguise
from herself her affection; she could scarcely tell
why she had yielded to the impulse of that fatal moment;
but she felt that she had lost irretrievably the
esteem and the affections of her cousin. She would
have given worlds to have recalled the last hour.
Even now she might, by seeking him, and throwing
herself at his feet, perhaps, regain his love. She rose
to do so. But when her hand was on the lock she
thought that he might spurn her. She hesitated. In
another moment her pride had regained the mastery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—I cannot—I dare not. He will turn away
from me. He will despise me. Oh! that I had never,
never said those idle words,” and flinging herself
again on the bed, she wept long and bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary appeared that evening at the supper table,
but in the cold and averted looks of Ashton, she saw
only new causes for pride. The evening passed off
heavily. As the time came for retiring, Henry approached
her to bid her farewell. She thought her
heart would burst her boddice, but commanding her
emotion by a violent effort, she returned his adieu as
calmly as it was given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they parted, both in seeming carelessness, but
one at least in agony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry Ashton had known his lovely cousin scarcely
two years, but during that time, she had been to
him a divinity. Never, in his wildest dreams, had
he imagined a countenance more surpassingly beautiful
than hers, and to her, accordingly, he had given
his heart, with a devotion which had become a part
of his nature. But much as he adored his cousin, he
was not wholly blind to her faults. He saw that she
loved admiration, and he feared she was too much of
a flirt. Yet his love had gone on increasing, and, he
fancied, not without a return. Led on by his hopes,
he had, during a temporary visit at her father’s house,
seized an opportunity to declare his passion, but how
the half breathed avowal was checked, we will not
recapitulate. Need we wonder at his sudden resolution
to fly from her presence, and, by placing the
ocean between them, to eradicate a passion for one
whom he now felt to be unworthy of him? Few men
could be more energetic than Ashton. In less than a
week, he had sailed for Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! how Mary wept his departure! A thousand
times she was on the point of writing to recall him,
but her pride as often prevented the act. She hoped
he might yet return. Surely—she said—he who
had once loved her so deeply, and who must have
known that his affection was returned, would not
leave her forever. Hour after hour she would sit
watching the gate for his return, and hour after hour
she experienced all the bitterness of disappointment.
When, at length, she read in the newspaper that he
had really sailed, she gave one long, loud shriek, and
fell senseless to the floor. A fever, that ensued,
brought her to the very brink of the grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ashton went forth upon the world an altered, almost
a misanthropic man. His hopes were withered:
his first dream of love had vanished: he felt as if
there was nothing for him to live for in this world.
His mind became almost diseased. He loathed society,
then he veered to the other extreme, and craved
after excitement. He sought relief in travel. He
crossed the steppes of Tartary—he traversed the
deserts of Arabia—he lived among the weird and
ruined monuments of Egypt,—and for years he wandered,
a stranger to civilization, seeking only one
thing—<span class='it'>to forget</span>. He never inquired after America.
His family were all dead, and he wished never to think
of Mary. Like the fabled victim, in the olden legend,
he spent years in the vain search after that
Lethe whose waters are reserved for death alone. He
found it not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mary, too, was changed. She rose from that
bed of sickness an altered being. Never had she
known the full depth of her affection until the moment
when she found herself deserted. The shock
almost destroyed her; and though she recovered after
a long and weary sickness, it was to discard all her
old habits, and to assume a quieter—yet, oh! how
far more beautiful demeanor than in her days of
unmitigated joy. She felt that Henry was lost to her
forever, yet she derived a melancholy pleasure in
living as if the eye of her absent lover was upon her.
She directed her whole conduct so as to meet his approbation.
Alas! he was far away: she had not
heard from him for years; perhaps, too, he might be
no more; then why this constant reference of all she
did to his standard of excellence? It was her deep
abiding love which did it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four years had passed when Ashton found himself
again in America, and sitting, after dinner, with one
of his most intimate friends, at the table of the ——
hotel. For some time the bottle passed in silence.
At length his companion spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have not seen Mary Derwentwater yet—have
you, Harry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ashton answered calmly, with a forced effort, in
the negative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must not positively delay it. Do you know
how beautiful she has grown?—far more beautiful
than when you went away, although then you thought
her surpassingly lovely.” He paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not heard from the family for years,” said
Ashton at length, feeling that his companion expected
some reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you know nothing of her?—push us some
of the almonds—why, my dear fellow, she is irresistible.
But she is different from what she used to be;
her beauty is softer, though not so showy, and whereas
she once would flirt a little—mind, only a little, for
she is a great favorite of mine—she now goes by the
name of the cold beauty. A married man, like myself,
can speak thus warmly, you know, without fear
of having his heart called in as the bribe of his head.
And do you know that my wife suspects you of having
worked the reformation?”—Ashton started, and was
almost thrown off his guard—“for it began immediately
after a long illness, that happened a few
weeks after you sailed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ashton was completely bewildered. He had now
for the first time heard of Mary’s sickness. His eye
wandered from that of his companion, and he felt his
cheek flushing in despite of himself. He covered his
embarrassment, however, by rising. His companion
continued,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, Harry, let us stroll down Broadway,
for, to tell the truth, I promised my wife to bring you
home with me. Besides, Mary is there, and I’ve no
doubt,” he continued, jocularly, “you are dying to
meet her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ashton could not answer; but he followed his friend
into the street, conscious that Mary and he must meet,
and feeling that the sooner it was done the better.
His companion, during their walk, ran on in his usual
gay style, but Harry scarcely heard a word that was
said. His thoughts were full of his cousin. Had she
indeed become cold to all other men from love to himself?
Strange and yet delicious thoughts whirled
through his mind, and he woke only from his abstraction
on finding himself in Seacourt’s drawing-room,
and in the presence of his cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary was on a visit to Mrs. Seacourt, and did not
know of Ashton’s intended coming until a few minutes
before he made his appearance. Devotedly as she
loved her cousin, she would have given worlds to escape
the interview; but retreat was impossible, without
exposing the long treasured secret of her heart.
She nerved herself, accordingly, for the meeting, and
succeeded in assuming a sufficiently composed demeanor
to greet her cousin without betraying her agitation.
He exchanged the common compliments of
the occasion with her, and then took a seat by Mrs.
Seacourt, who had been one of his old friends. Mary
felt the neglect; she saw he did not love her. That
night she wept bitter tears of anguish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet I cannot blame him. Oh, no!” she exclaimed,
“it is all my own fault. He once loved me,
and I heartlessly flung that affection from me which
I would give worlds now to win. But I must dry
these tears; I must not betray myself. We shall
meet daily, for he cannot help coming here, and to
shorten my visit would lead to suspicions. I must
therefore school myself to disguise the secret of my
heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Ashton did come daily, and although his conversation
was chiefly devoted to Mrs. Seacourt, he
neither seemed to seek nor to avoid his cousin. Now
and then he found himself deep in a conversation with
her, and he thought of old times. But the memory of
their last interview came across him at such moments
like a blight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How wonderfully Ashton has improved since his
travels,” said Mrs. Seacourt one morning, as she and
Mary sat <span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span>, sewing; “and do you know,”
continued she, looking archly at her companion,
“that I deem myself indebted to you for his charming
visits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary felt the blood mounting to her brow, and she
stooped to pick out a stitch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! you are always jesting, Anne; you know it
is not so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall see. I prophesy that this afternoon,
when we go to the exhibition, he will escort you, and
leave Miss Thornbury to Seacourt’s nephew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary’s heart beat so she could scarcely answer,
but she managed to reply,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t, my dear Mrs. Seacourt, don’t tease one
this way. You know, indeed you know, Ashton cares
nothing for me,” and she felt how great a relief would
have been a flood of tears, could she have indulged in
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Seacourt smiled archly, and said no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The afternoon came. The little company were assembled
in the drawing-room. Ashton entered just
as the last moment had come, and when the ladies
were rising to go. Mary was almost hidden in one
corner, so fearful was she of attracting the raillery of
Mrs. Seacourt, by placing herself near the entrance,
and in Ashton’s way. Her very sensitiveness produced
the effect she wished to avoid. The gentlemen
naturally sought partners nearest them, and for
a moment she was left almost alone. She thought
she would have fainted when she saw her cousin cross
the room and offer to be her escort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They proceeded to the exhibition. For the first
time for years, Ashton’s arm upheld that of Mary.
At first both were embarrassed; but each made an
effort, and they soon glided into conversation on indifferent
subjects. What a relief it was to Mary that
night, to think she had been alone, as it were, with
her cousin without being treated with neglect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that day the visits of Ashton to Mrs. Seacourt’s
increased in frequency, yet there was nothing
marked in his attentions to Mary. Indeed, he still
continued to converse chiefly with his friend’s wife,
though he did not openly avoid her guest. Mary
grew more and more tremblingly alive to his presence,
and at times, when she would detect his eye
bent on her, half sadly, half abstractedly, her heart
would flutter wildly, and a delicious hope would
momently shoot across her mind; but soon to fade as
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning, Ashton entered the drawing-room,
and found her alone. She was untangling a skein of
silk. She arose, and said, with some embarrassment,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Seacourt is up stairs; I will ring for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for the world, if she is in any way engaged.
I can await her pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a silence of some minutes. Mary could
scarcely breathe: she knew not what to say. Her
fingers refused to perform their duty, and her skein of
silk became more and more entangled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I help you?” said Ashton, approaching
her. “My patience used to be a proverb with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary could not trust herself to answer, for her fingers
were actually trembling with agitation. She
felt she could have sunk into the floor. She proffered
the silk without looking up. Ashton took hold of one
end while she retained the other. Neither spoke;
but Mary’s bosom heaved tumultuously, while Ashton
felt his heart in his throat. At length, in mutually
untangling the skein, their hands met. The
touch thrilled them like lightning. Ashton almost
unconsciously retained the hand of his cousin in his
own. She trembled violently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked half doubtingly, half timidly up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary, we love each other—do we not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no answer, but as he pressed the fingers
lying passively in his grasp, the pressure was gently
returned, and, bursting into tears, his cousin fell upon
his bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Ashton and Mary have been wedded for years,
but their honey-moon still continues, for they have
not yet quarrelled.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>“So</span> you are really going to be married, Charles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, uncle; and I hope you will agree with me
in thinking that I have made a very prudent choice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That remains to be seen yet,” said Mr. Waterton.
“In the first place, who is the lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Laura Tarleton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know her <span class='it'>name</span> well enough, for you have
scarcely uttered any other one these six weeks,”
was the crusty reply; “but I want to know something
of her family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her father was a southern merchant, and died
four or five years since, leaving only two daughters
to inherit his large estate; one of these daughters
married about two years since, and is now in Europe;
the other I hope to introduce to your affections as
my wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has she no mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her mother died while she was yet very young.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where was she educated?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the fashionable boarding-school of Madame
Finesse, and I can assure you no expense has been
spared in her education.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare say not: these new-fangled establishments
for the manufacture of man-traps, don’t usually spare
expense. How old is your intended wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just nineteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where has she lived since she left school, for I
suppose she was ‘<span class='it'>finished</span>,’ as they style it, some
years since?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has resided lately at the Astor House, under
the protection of a relative who boards there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she cannot know much about housekeeping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare say not,” replied Charles, with a slight
feeling of vexation, “but all that knowledge comes
by practice, uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If her time has been divided between a boarding
school and a hotel, where is she to learn any thing
about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, women seem to have an intuitive knowledge
of such things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mistaken, boy,” said the old man, “if a
girl has been brought up in a good home, and sees a
regular system of housekeeping constantly pursued,
she will become unconsciously familiar with its details,
even though she may not then put such knowledge
in practice; the consequence will be that when
she is the mistress of a house, her memory will assist
her judgment—a quality, by the way, not too common
in girls of nineteen. But how is a poor thing
who has seen nothing but the <span class='it'>skimble-skamble</span> of a
school-household or the clockwork regularity of a
great hotel, to know any of the machinery by which
the comfort of a home is obtained and secured?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh I am not afraid to trust to Laura,” replied
Charles with animation, “she is young, good-tempered,
and, I believe, loves me; so I have every security
for the future. When there’s a will there’s always a
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, true, Charles, and I only hope your wife
may have the will to find the right way; what is her
fortune?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reports vary respecting the amount—some say
eighty, others, one hundred thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t <span class='it'>you know</span> any thing about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that her fortune is very considerable, especially
for a poor devil like me, who can barely
clear two thousand a year by business,” answered
Charles, with some irritation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When your father married, Charles, he was master
of only three hundred dollars in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may be, and the consequence was that my
father’s son has been obliged to work like a dog all
his life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The very best thing that could have happened to
you, my dear boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you make that out? For my part, I see
nothing very desirable in poverty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor do I, Charles; poverty is certainly an evil,
but it is an evil to which you have never been exposed;
competence was the reward of your father’s industry
and he was thus enabled to bestow a good education
and good habits upon his son. The limited range of
your own experience will convince you of the danger
of great riches. Who are the persons in our great
city most notorious for vice and folly? Who are the
horse-jockies, the gamblers, the rowdies, and the
fools of high life? Why, they are the sons of our
rich men, and how can we expect better things from
those who from their very childhood are pampered
in idleness and luxury. I know you will tell me
there are exceptions to this sweeping censure, and
this I am willing to allow, for there are some minds
which even the influence of wealth cannot injure; but
how few are they, compared with the number of
those who are ruined in their very infancy by the
possession of riches. Depend upon it, Charles, that
learning, industry, and virtue form the best inheritance
which any man can derive from his ancestors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a pity the world would not think so, uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is, boy; but the fact is such as I have stated,
whatever the majority of people may think. You
have not now to learn that the wise and good are
always in the <span class='it'>minority</span> in this world. But tell me
one thing, my dear boy; if Miss Tarleton was poor
and friendless, instead of being rich and fashionable,
would you have fallen in love with her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why yes—certainly—I don’t know—” stammered
Charles, confusedly, “but that is supposing so
improbable a case that I cannot determine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose she were suddenly to be deprived of her
fortune,” said the persevering old man, “would you
still be so desirous of wedding her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, to tell you the honest truth, uncle, I do not
think I should, and for an excellent reason. Laura
has been brought up as a rich man’s daughter, and
therefore can scarcely be expected to have had proper
training for a poor man’s wife. If I were compelled
to support a family on my paltry business, it
would be necessary to have a more prudent and economical
companion than Laura is likely to prove; but,
thank heaven, that is not the case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All are liable to reverses of fortune, Charles, and
should such befal you in future, you might chance to
find that a prudent wife without money is a better
companion in misfortune than an extravagant one
who brought a rich dowry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear uncle, do not imagine all kinds of unpleasant
contingencies; the idea of what you call a
<span class='it'>prudent woman</span> is shocking to my notions of feminine
character; it always conjures up in my mind an
image of a sharp-voiced, keen-eyed creature, scolding
at servants, fretting at children, and clattering slip-shod
about the house to look after candle-ends and
cheese-parings. Before a woman can become parsimonious
she must in a measure unsex herself, since
the foible most natural to the sex is extravagance—the
excess of a liberal spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mistaken, Charles; that there are such
women as you describe, bustling, notable housewives,
who pride themselves on their ability to <span class='it'>manage</span>, as
they term it, and who practise cunning because unable
to use force, I acknowledge; but they are chiefly to
be found among those who have been placed in an
unnatural position in society,—women, who having
neither father, brother nor husband to protect them,
have been obliged to struggle with the world, and
have learned to <span class='it'>jostle</span> lest they should <span class='it'>be jostled</span> in
the race of life. But bachelor as I am, I have had
many opportunities of studying the sex, and I can
assure you that economy, frugality and industry are
by no means incompatible with feminine delicacy,
refinement of thought, and elegant accomplishments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well it may be all true, uncle,” replied Charles,
utterly wearied of the old man’s lecture, “but it is
too late to reflect upon the matter now, even if I
were so disposed. I am to be married next week,
and I hope when you see Laura, you will think, with
me, and give me credit for more prudence than you
seem to believe I possess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles Wharton possessed good feelings, and, as
he believed, good principles; yet, seduced by the
ambition of equalling his richer neighbors, he had persuaded
himself into choosing a wife, less from affection
than from motives of interest. Had Laura Tarleton
been poor, he certainly would never have thought
of her, since, pretty as she was, she lacked the brilliancy
of character which he had always admired.
But there was a sin upon his conscience, known only
to himself and <span class='it'>one</span> other, which often clouded his
brow, even in the midst of his anticipated triumph.
There was a young, fair, and gifted girl, whom he
had loved with all the fervor of sincere attachment,
and <span class='it'>he knew</span> that she loved him, although no word
on the subject had been uttered by either. He knew
that his looks, and tones, and actions had been to her
those of a lover, and he had little reason to doubt
the feeling with which he had been met. He had
looked forward to the time when he should be quietly
settled amid the comforts of a peaceful home, and
the image of <span class='it'>that fair girl</span> was always the prominent
object in his pictures for the future. But a
change came over the spirit of the whole nation.
Wealth poured into the country—or at least what
was then considered wealth—and with it came luxury
and sloth. The golden stream came to <span class='it'>some</span> like
a mountain torrent, and others began to repine at
receiving it only as the tiny rivulet. People “made
haste to be rich,” and Charles Waterton was infected
with the same thirst after wealth. He met with
Laura Tarleton, learned that she was an orphan
heiress, and instantly determined to secure the glittering
prize. Ambition conquered the tenderness of
his nature; he forsook the lady of his love, and after
an acquaintance of six weeks succeeded in becoming
the husband of the wealthy votary of fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not long after his marriage, he discovered one
<span class='it'>slight</span> error in his calculations, and found that his
wife’s hundred thousand dollars had in reality dwindled
down to thirty thousand. But even this was not
to be despised, and Charles, conscious that he had
nothing but talents and industry when he commenced
life, felt that he had drawn a prize in the lottery.
Grateful to his wife for her preference of him, and
conscious that he had not bestowed on her his full
affection, he determined to make all the amends in
his power, by lavishing every kindness upon her, and
submitting implicitly to her wishes. Having intimated
to him that she should prefer boarding during
the first year of their married life, he accordingly engaged
a suite of apartments at the Astor House,
where they lived in a style of splendor and ease exceedingly
agreeable to the taste of both. Mrs. Waterton
was extremely pretty, with an innocent, child-like
face, and a graceful figure, and Charles felt so much
pride in the admiration which she received in society,
that he forgot to notice her mental deficiency. Their
time was passed in a perpetual round of excitement
and gayety. During the hours when the counting
room claimed the husband’s attention, the young wife
lounged on a sofa, read the last new novel, dawdled
through a morning’s shopping, or paid fashionable
visits. The afternoon was spent over the dinner table,
while the evening soon passed in the midst of a
brilliant party, or amid the pleasures of some public
amusement. But living in the bustle of a hotel, with
a large circle of acquaintances always ready to drink
Mr. Waterton’s wine and flirt with his pretty wife,
they were rarely left to each other’s society, and at
the termination of the first twelvemonth, they knew
little more of each other’s tempers and feelings than
when they pledged their vows at the altar. Charles
had learned that his placid Laura was somewhat pertinacious
and very fond of dress, while she had been
deeply mortified by the discovery that Charles’s deceased
mother had, during her widowhood, kept a
thread and needle store; but this was all that they
had ascertained of each other. There had been no
studying of each other’s character—no opportunity of
practising that <span class='it'>adaptation</span> so necessary to the comfort
of married life. They had lived only in a crowd,
and were as yet in the position of partners in a quadrille,
associated rather for a season of gayety than
for the changeful scenes of actual life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commencement of the second year found the
young couple busily engaged in preparing for house-keeping.
A stately house, newly built and situated
in a fashionable part of the city, was selected by
Mrs. Waterton, and purchased by her obsequious
husband in obedience to her wishes, though he did
not think it necessary to inform her that <span class='it'>two thirds</span>
of the purchase money was to remain on mortgage.
They now only awaited the arrival of the rich furniture
which Mrs. Waterton had directed her sister to
select in Paris. This came at length, and with all
the glee of a child she beheld her house fitted with
carpets of such turf-like softness that the foot was almost
buried in their bright flowers; mirrors that
might have served for walls to the palace of truth;
couches, divans and fauteuils, inlaid with gold and
covered with velvet most exquisitely painted; curtains,
whose costly texture had been quadrupled in
value by the skill of the embroideress; tables of the
finest mosaic; lustres and girandoles of every variety,
glittering with their wealth of gold and chrystal;
and all the thousand expensive toys which serve to
minister to the frivolous tastes of fashion. The
arrangement of the sleeping apartments was on a
scale of equal magnificence. French dressing tables,
with all their paraphernalia of Sevres china and
chrystal; Psyche glasses, in frames of ivory and
gold; beds of rosewood, inlaid with ivory, and canopied
with gold and silver, were among the decorations.
But should the reader seek to ascend still higher—the
upper rooms—the servants’ apartments, uncarpeted,
unfurnished, destitute of all the comforts
which are as necessary to domestics as to their superiors,
would have been found to afford a striking contrast
to the splendors of those parts of the mansion
which were intended for display.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With all his good sense, Charles Waterton was yet
weak enough to indulge a feeling of exultation as he
looked round his magnificent house, and felt himself
“master of all he surveyed.” His thoughts went
back to the time when the death of his father had
plunged the family almost into destitution—when his
mother had been aided to open a little shop, of which
he was chief clerk, until the kindness of his old uncle
had procured for him a situation in a wholesale
store, which had finally enabled him to reach his present
eminence. He remembered how often he had
stood behind a little counter to sell a penny ball of
thread or a piece of tape—how often he had been
snubbed and scolded at when subject to the authority
of a purse-proud employer—and, in spite of his better
reason, Charles felt proud and triumphant. His
self-satisfaction was somewhat diminished, however,
by the sight of a bill drawn upon him by his brother-in-law
in Paris, for the sums due on this great display
of elegance. Ten thousand dollars—one third
of his wife’s fortune—just sufficed to <span class='it'>furnish</span> their
new house. Thus seven hundred dollars was cut off
from their annual income, to be consumed in the
wear and tear of their costly gew-gaws; another
thousand was devoted to the payment of interest on
the mortgage which remained on his house; so that,
at the very outset of his career, Charles found himself,
notwithstanding his wife’s estate, reduced to the
“<span class='it'>paltry two thousand a year</span>,” which he derived
from his business. But he had too much false pride
to confess the truth to his wife, and at once to alter
their style of living. Each had been deceived in
their estimate of the other’s wealth. Laura’s income
had been large enough, while she remained single, to
allow her indulgence in every whim, and Charles,
ambitious of the reputation of a man of fashion, after
slaving all the morning in his office, had been in the
habit of driving fast trotting horses, or sporting a tilbury
and tiger in Broadway, every afternoon, spending
every cent of his income, and giving rise to the
belief among the young men that he was very rich,
while the old merchants only looked upon him as
very imprudent. They were now to learn that their
combined fortunes would not support the extravagancies
of a household, but Laura, accustomed to the
command of money from childhood, knew not its value,
because she had never known its want, and her
husband shrunk from the duty of enlightening her on
the subject, by informing her of their real situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time the arrangements of their house were
completed, and had been admired, envied and sneered
at by her “dear five thousand friends,” the season arrived
for Mrs. Waterton’s usual visit to Saratoga.
Her husband of course accompanied her, though with
rather a heavy heart, for he knew that only by close
attention to business he could hope to provide the
necessary funds for all such expenditures, although
he had not sufficient moral courage to confess that
he was so closely chained to the galley of commerce.
The usual round of gayety was traversed—the summer
was spent in lounging at different watering
places—and the autumn found them returning, heartily
wearied, to their splendid home. With the assistance
of some kind <span class='it'>suggestors</span>, Mrs. Waterton now
planned a series of entertainments for the coming
winter, and Charles listened with ill-dissembled
anxiety to the schemes for balls, parties, soirees, musical
festivals and suppers. There was but one way
to support all this. Charles determined to extend
his business, and instead of confining himself to a
regular cash trade, he resolved to follow the example
of his neighbors, and engage in speculation. Accordingly,
he sold his wife’s stock in several moneyed
institutions, and, investing the proceeds in merchandise,
commenced making money on a grander scale.
This was in the beginning of the year ’36, and every
one knows the excitement of that momentous season;
a season not soon to be forgotten by the bankrupt
merchants, the distressed wives and the beggared
children who can date their misfortunes from the
temporary inflation of the credit system, by which
that fatal year was characterized. Mr. Waterton’s
books soon showed an immense increase of business,
and, upon the most moderate calculation, his profits
could scarcely be less than from eight to ten thousand
dollars within six months. This was doing
pretty well for a man who had formerly been content
with a “paltry two thousand a year,” but as avarice,
like jealousy, “grows by what it feeds on,” Charles
began to think he might as well make money in more
ways than one. He therefore began to buy real estate,
and <span class='it'>pine lands</span> in Maine, <span class='it'>wild tracts</span> in Indiana,
<span class='it'>town lots</span> in Illinois, together with the thousand
schemes which then filled the heads of the sanguine
and the pockets of the cunning, claimed his attention
and obtained his money; while, at the same time,
the fashionable society of New York were in raptures
with Mrs. Waterton’s splendid parties, her costly
equipage, and her magnificent style of dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you counted the cost of all these things,
Charles?” said his old uncle, as he entered the house
one morning, and beheld the disarray consequent
upon a large party the previous night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, uncle, I think I have,” said Charles, smiling,
as he sipped his coffee, at the old man’s simplicity.
“The fellows who manage these affairs soon compel
us to count the cost, for when I came down this
morning, I found on the breakfast table this bill for
nine hundred and fifty-four dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nine hundred dollars, Charles! You don’t mean
to say that your party last night cost that sum?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do, my dear sir, and considering that the bill
includes every thing but the wines, I do not consider
it an exorbitant one; however, the elegant colored
gentleman who takes all this trouble for me does not
charge me quite so much as he would if I employed
him less frequently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man looked round and sighed. The apartments
were in sad disorder, for the servants, overcome
by the fatigues of the previous day, had followed
the example of their master, and stolen from the
morning the sleep they had been denied at night. A
bottle lay shivered in one corner of the supper room,
the champaigne with which it had been filled soaking
into the rich carpet—a piece of plum-cake had been
crushed by some heedless foot into the snow-white
rug which lay before the drawing-room fire—the
sweeping draperies of one of the curtains was still
dripping with something which bore a marvellous resemblance
to melted ice cream, and the whole suite
of apartments wore that air of desolation which
usually characterizes a “banquet hall deserted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you calculate the destruction of furniture in
counting the cost of your parties, Charles?” asked
Mr. Waterton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no—that of course is expected; furniture, you
know, becomes old-fashioned and requires to be renewed
about every three years, and therefore one
may as well have the use of it while it is new.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must have a vast addition to your fortune if
you expect to pay for all these things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear sir,” replied the nephew, with a most
benignant smile at his uncle’s superlative ignorance
of his affairs, “my dear sir, you do not seem to
know that, in the course of about three years, I shall
be one of the richest men in New York.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you sell on credit?” asked the old man, significantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly; everybody does so now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, my boy, take an old man’s advice,
and don’t count your chickens before they are hatched;
don’t live on ten thousand a year when that sum
exists only in your ledger. Call in your debts, and
when your customers have <span class='it'>paid</span>, then tell me how
<span class='it'>much</span> you have <span class='it'>gained</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear uncle, you are quite obsolete in your
notions. I wish I could induce you to enter with me
into a new scheme; it would make your fortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am content with my present condition, Charles;
my salary of eight hundred a year is quite sufficient
for the wants of a bachelor, and leaves me a little for
the wants of others; nor would I sacrifice my peace
of mind and quiet of conscience for all the fortunes
that will ever be made by speculation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not necessary to sacrifice either peace or
principle in making a fortune, uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have not seen the end yet, my dear boy; I
have lived long enough to behold several kinds of
<span class='it'>speculative mania</span>, and all terminated in a similarly
unfortunate manner. It is a spirit of gambling which
is abroad, and I am old-fashioned enough to believe
that money thus obtained never does good to any one.
It is like the price of a soul: the devil is sure to
cheat the unhappy bargainer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How I hate to hear people talk about business,”
lisped Mrs. Waterton, as she sat listlessly in her
loose wrapping-gown at the breakfast table; “I think
no one ought to mention the word before ladies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man looked at her with ill-disguised contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be well for you, young lady,” said he, “if
you never have to learn the necessity of a knowledge
of business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Laura put up her pretty lip, but was silent, for she
was much too indolent, and rather too well bred, to
get angry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles Waterton had given his uncle what he believed
to be an accurate view of his circumstances.
Excited beyond the bounds of sober sense by his
seeming success, he was as sanguine a dupe as ever
bled beneath the leech-craft of speculation. His real
estate, which he <span class='it'>very moderately</span> estimated at <span class='it'>quintuple</span>
its cost, formed, <span class='it'>at such prices</span>, an immense
fortune. His book debts were enormous, for his money
was scattered east, west, north and south, and in consequence
of giving long credits, he was enabled to obtain
exorbitant profits. But the Eldorado whose boundaries
seemed so accurately defined on paper, became
exceedingly indistinct as he fancied himself about
to approach its shores. The following year began to
afford tokens of coming trouble. Credit was still
good, but money had entirely disappeared from the
community, and men who had learned to make notes
in order to <span class='it'>acquire fortunes</span>, were now obliged to
continue their manufacture in order to <span class='it'>avoid ruin</span>.
Rumors of approaching distress arose in the money
market; men began to look with distrust upon their
fellows, and as unlimited confidence in each other
had been the foundation of the towering edifice of
unstable prosperity, the moment that was shaken,
the whole structure fell crumbling to the earth. As
soon as doubt arose, destruction was at hand, and at
length one wild crash of almost universal bankruptcy
startled the dreamers from their golden visions.</p>

<hr class='tbk112'/>

<p class='pindent'>One fine morning in the spring of 1838, the doors of
one of the most stately houses in —— street, were
thrown open to the public, and the auctioneer’s flag
waving from the window gave a general invitation to
every passer by. That ominous red flag! no less
significant of evil than the black banner of the rover
of the seas; for it is ever the signal of the disruption
of household ties. That ominous red flag! sometimes
betokening the instability of fortune—sometimes
the work of death—sometimes telling of
blighted fortunes—sometimes of broken hearts, but
<span class='it'>always</span> of discomfort and disquiet. And yet few
things will so readily collect a concourse of people
as that scarlet harbinger of destruction. There may
be found the regular auction-haunters, men of idleness,
bachelors, perhaps, glad to find an hour or two
killed beneath the auctioneer’s hammer—single ladies
of small fortunes, who have nothing to do for
themselves, and have not yet learned the luxury of
doing something for their neighbors—notable housewives,
actuated by a sense of duty and a love of economy,
who waste <span class='it'>nothing but time</span> in their hunt after
bargains—young ladies who come to see how such
persons furnished their houses—and perhaps some
would-be connoisseur in search of old pictures, which,
if they have only hung long enough over a smoky
fire-place, may be classed with the works of the old
masters. On the morning in question, however, unusual
attractions were offered to the visiters of such
places, for it was the abode of wealth, and luxury,
and taste which was thus desecrated—the mansion
of the Watertons! The rich carpets were disfigured
by many a dirty footstep,—the velvet couches bore
the impress of many a soiling touch, and many a rude
hand was laid upon the delicate and costly toys
which had once been the admiration of the fashionable
visitants of the family. Among the crowd were
two of that <span class='it'>numerous tribe</span> found in the very midst
of fashionable life, who have learned the trick of
combining meanness and extravagance—women who
will spend hundreds upon a shawl, and at the same
time beat down the wages of a poor sempstress until
she is almost compelled to purchase with life itself
the bread which ought to sustain life. Such were the
two who now seated themselves in the drawing-room
of the ruined family, in order to be in the <span class='it'>right place</span>
when certain articles were put up for sale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want nothing here,” said one, with a half
scornful air, “except those mosaic tables; the carpets
and curtains are ruined by carelessness, and no
wonder, for Mrs. Waterton was a wretched house-keeper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I only mean to buy that workbox,” said the
other; “Mrs. Waterton told me it cost a thousand
francs in Paris, and I am sure it will not sell for one
fourth its cost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, have you seen her since her husband’s
failure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no, I shouldn’t think of calling upon her when
in so much distress; besides, I am told she has refused
to see any one. Did you hear how she behaved
when she heard of Mr. Waterton’s reverses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I know nothing about her since she gave her
last grand party, which was followed in a few days
by his bankruptcy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why I was told she raved like a mad woman, reproached
her husband in the vilest terms for thus reducing
her to poverty, taunted him with his low
origin, and accused him of the basest deception.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can easily believe it, for these mild, placid
milk-and-water women have got the temper of demons
when once aroused.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not told you all yet; she refused to give
up her jewels, which were known to be of great value,
and having secretly employed a person to dispose of
them for her, she took passage for France, and actually
set sail a few days since; merely informing
her husband <span class='it'>by letter</span> that such was her purpose.
This letter she placed in such hands that she knew
he would not receive it until the vessel was underweigh,
and he thus learned that she had deserted him
forever. She pretends to have gone to join her sister;
but there is a whisper of a certain black-whiskered
foreigner who is the companion of her voyage. At
any rate, whether he goes with her or not, he is a
fellow passenger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is Mr. Waterton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the house of his old uncle, who will probably
be obliged to transfer him to a lunatic asylum before
long; but hush, the auctioneer is coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have told you the <span class='it'>dénouement</span> as related by the
heartless women of the world, but like most of their
species, they were only <span class='it'>half right</span>. Mrs. Waterton
<span class='it'>did</span> go with the intention of seeking her sister’s protection,
but ere she arrived there, she was persuaded
to travel farther under the protection of her fascinating
friend. Mr. Waterton did not enter a lunatic
asylum, but recovered his senses so fully that he obtained
a divorce from his wife, and is now a fellow-clerk
with his uncle; enjoying as much tranquility
as a remembrance of his former follies, his imprudent
choice, and his three years of wedded life will allow.</p>

<p class='line0'><span class='sc'>There</span> is an isle in the far south sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>Sunny and bright as an isle can be;</p>
<p class='line0'>Sweet is the sound of the ocean wave,</p>
<p class='line0'>As its sparkling waters the green shores lave;</p>
<p class='line0'>And from the shell that upon the strand</p>
<p class='line0'>Lies half buried in golden sand—</p>
<p class='line0'>A thrilling tone through the still air rings,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like music trembling on fairy strings.</p>
<p class='line0'>Flowers like those which the Peris find</p>
<p class='line0'>In the bowers of their paradise, and bind</p>
<p class='line0'>In the flowing tresses, are blooming there,</p>
<p class='line0'>And gay birds glance through the scented air.</p>
<p class='line0'>Gems and pearls are strew’d on the earth</p>
<p class='line0'>Untouch’d—there are none to know their worth;</p>
<p class='line0'>And that fair island death comes not nigh:</p>
<p class='line0'>Why should he come?—there are none to die.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>My heart had grown, like the Misanthrope’s,</p>
<p class='line0'>Cold and dead to all human hopes;</p>
<p class='line0'>Fame and fortune alike had proved</p>
<p class='line0'>Baseless dreams, and the friends I loved</p>
<p class='line0'>Vanish’d away, like the flowers that fade</p>
<p class='line0'>In the deadly blight of the Upas shade.</p>
<p class='line0'>I long’d upon that green isle to be,</p>
<p class='line0'>Far away o’er the sounding sea;</p>
<p class='line0'>Where no human voice, with its words of pain,</p>
<p class='line0'>Could ever fall on my ear again.</p>
<p class='line0'>Life seem’d a desert waste to me,</p>
<p class='line0'>And I sought in slumber from care to flee.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Away, away, o’er the waters blue,</p>
<p class='line0'>Light as a sea-bird the vessel flew.</p>
<p class='line0'>Deep ocean furrows her timbers plow,</p>
<p class='line0'>As the waves are parted before her prow;</p>
<p class='line0'>And the foaming billows close o’er her path,</p>
<p class='line0'>Hissing and roaring, as if in wrath.</p>
<p class='line0'>But swiftly onward, through foam and spray,</p>
<p class='line0'>To the lonely island she steers her way.</p>
<p class='line0'>The heavens above wore their brightest smile,</p>
<p class='line0'>As the bark was moor’d by that fairy isle;</p>
<p class='line0'>The sails were furl’d, the voyage was o’er:</p>
<p class='line0'>I should buffet the waves of the world no more.</p>
<p class='line0'>I look’d to the ocean—the bark was gone,</p>
<p class='line0'>And I stood on that beautiful isle, alone.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>My wish was granted, and I was blest;</p>
<p class='line0'>My spirit revell’d in perfect rest,—</p>
<p class='line0'>A Dead Sea calm,—even thought repos’d</p>
<p class='line0'>Like a weary dove with its pinions closed.</p>
<p class='line0'>Beauty was round me: bright roses hung</p>
<p class='line0'>Their blushing wreaths o’er my head, and flung</p>
<p class='line0'>Fragrance abroad on the gale, to me</p>
<p class='line0'>Sweeter than odors of Araby;</p>
<p class='line0'>Wealth was mine, for the yellow gold</p>
<p class='line0'>Lay before me in heaps untold.</p>
<p class='line0'>Death to that island knew not the way,</p>
<p class='line0'>But life was mine for ever and aye,</p>
<p class='line0'>Till Love again made my heart its throne,</p>
<p class='line0'>And I ceased to dwell on the isle, alone.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Long did my footsteps delighted range</p>
<p class='line0'>My peaceful home, but there came a change;</p>
<p class='line0'>My heart grew sad, and I looked with pain</p>
<p class='line0'>On all I had barter’d life’s ties to gain.</p>
<p class='line0'>A chilling weight on my spirits fell,</p>
<p class='line0'>As the low, soft wail of the ocean shell—</p>
<p class='line0'>Or the bee’s faint hum in the flowery wood,</p>
<p class='line0'>Was all that broke on my solitude.</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh! then I felt, in my loneliness,</p>
<p class='line0'>That earth had no power the heart to bless,</p>
<p class='line0'>Unwarm’d by affection’s holy ray;</p>
<p class='line0'>And hope was withered, as day by day</p>
<p class='line0'>I watch’d for the bark, but in vain, in vain;</p>
<p class='line0'>She never sought that green isle again.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I stretch’d my arms o’er the heaving sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>And pray’d aloud, in my agony,</p>
<p class='line0'>That Love’s pure spirit might with me dwell—</p>
<p class='line0'>Then rose the waves with a murmuring swell,</p>
<p class='line0'>Higher and higher, till nought was seen</p>
<p class='line0'>Where slept in beauty that islet green.</p>
<p class='line0'>The waters pass’d o’er me,—the spell was broke;</p>
<p class='line0'>From the dream of the lonely isle I woke,</p>
<p class='line0'>With a heart redeem’d from its selfish stain,</p>
<p class='line0'>To mingle in scenes of the world again</p>
<p class='line0'>With cheerful spirit—and rather share</p>
<p class='line0'>The pains and sorrows which mortals bear,</p>
<p class='line0'>Than dwell where no shade on my path is thrown,</p>
<p class='line0'>’Mid fadeless flowers and bright gems, alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>This</span> is certainly the most charming opera that
was ever produced,” said Mrs. Althorp, as the curtain
fell after the first act of Sonnambula, and she
turned round to entertain the company in her box;
“yet, after all, what an absurdity it is! However,
I must remember that I am growing old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me,” said Mr. Hartford, who sat behind
her, “elegance and beauty have no age.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely elegance has its Age, and it is that in
which Mr. Hartford lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Althorp’s <span class='it'>fiat</span> has, indeed, such potency
that it can make even me, in fact at least, the model
of elegance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My stamp,” she replied, “like that of the mint,
only ascertains the value of the metal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, in the mint of fashion which you administer,
there is such a seignorage as makes the coin far more
valuable than the bullion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Hartford, you talk operas,” said Mrs. Althorp,
who knew she could never beat him in the
charming absurdities of compliment, and was willing
to retire from the contest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of the Prima Donna to-night?”
said Miss Stanhope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think she has miscarried in nothing but her
singing, her acting and her speaking,” replied Mr.
Hartford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She certainly does not sing as well as she did.
She has sung too much; her voice is worn out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were speaking of the absurdity of the opera,
Mrs. Althorp,” said Hartford. “The matter has certainly
not been improved since the time when the
Earl of Chesterfield settled it, that when you go to the
opera, you must take leave of your understanding
and your senses with your half guinea at the door,
and give yourself up to the dominion of the ears and
eyes; in other words, you must live by sight, and not
by faith. But the repugnancy to reason is increased
by the manner of performing them in this country,
where part of the dialogue is spoken. The illusion
of the opera is by that means destroyed. You may
in time become accustomed to a race of beings whose
natural dialect is poetry, and whose common cadences
are music; but a set of people who let us see
from time to time that they can talk like ourselves,
and who yet, whenever they are excited, break out
into modulated strains of song—who speak their
common-places, and warble their exclamations—such
people shock our credulity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet it would seem that at Athens, where they
knew something about these things,” said Mr. Temple,
“the same confusion of the natural and the impossible
prevailed on the stage. The chorus usually
chanted its part, and was accompanied by music;
and as we find that the persons of the drama, in conversing
with them, frequently adopt the measure of
verse which they sung, we must suppose that the
former at such times sang. The chorus also often
employs the rhythm which was used in speaking, and
thus seems to have used the double dialect of recitation
and singing. Nay, the chorus, as it circled the
altar, employed a gliding step which resembled
dancing; so that the Greek drama partook of the
threefold nature of our tragedy, opera and ballet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have lost all my respect for the taste of the
Greeks,” said Mrs. Althorpe, “since I heard that
they painted their temples.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was savage, indeed, to paint their temples,”
said Mr. Hartford; “the more refined moderns only
paint their cheeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The French are the modern Athenians,” said
Miss Stanhope. “De Bourrienne says that the soldiers
who were with Napoleon in Egypt complained
bitterly of their privations, and longed especially for
the opera.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know who that person is that is talking
to the leader of the orchestra?” said Miss Stanhope,
directing the attention of Mrs. Althorpe to a young
man of very striking appearance, who stood just
within the door of the orchestra, and who seemed to
be giving some directions that were listened to with
great attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! that is Mr. Nivernois,” said Mrs. Althorpe;
“a very odd person, by the by; I intended to have
sent for him to sup with us to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a few moments, the door of the box opened,
and Mr. Nivernois came in. There was something
very remarkable in his appearance: regular, well-chiselled
features, of an Italian cast; pale complexion;
large, black, vivid eyes, and long, straight black
hair; in his countenance was an aspect of force and
fire, keen intellectual action, and the power of deep
passion. He was negligently dressed, and was very
careless in his manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This opera does not seem to be very popular to-night,”
said Mrs. Althorpe to him. “And yet it is
a fine one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay,” he replied, “if you were to set Austerlitz
or the Angel Gabriel to music, people would still
complain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned round to Mr. Hartford, and began to put
to him a variety of questions about music, with such
rapidity as gave him no time to answer one of them.
Hartford was ambitious to display his knowledge,
and would have been glad to confound his interrogator
by his superior taste. But the answer which he
had begun to one question was cut off by another,
and before that could be attended to, a third had succeeded.
When the string was ended, he was so perplexed
as to what he should reply to, and so stunned
by the fiery fervor of the questioning, that he remained
silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nivernois fixed his keen eyes upon him, and waited
an instant for the reply, which came not. He
then turned aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph!” said he; “for my part, I know nothing
of music; not I. I thought I did, until I played
three months every morning with Paganini. I would
not give up the struggle sooner. At the end of that
time I broke my fiddle, and abandoned fiddling forever.
It was necessary to do that, or throttle the
old hair-scraper. I should strangle with anguish in
my chair, if I knew that there was a man living who
could excel me in any thing I undertook. But what
can one do? We have but one life to live. We
are like felons, fumbling with a bunch of keys at the
outer door of the sanctuary of immortality, while
the police of death are hurrying after us round the
corner; and who knows whether he has got the right
key? No lasting fame can be founded on music.
No melody is immortal but that of the drum and the
cannon. That alone is eternally re-produced. How
the Corsican knew to touch that instrument!—the
Handel of the iron flute! What brave tunes they
played off at Borodino and at Eylau! What a concert
was given under the pyramids—the companies
in squares, the musicians at the angles, and the shod
feet of the Mameluke cavalry marking time upon the
crusted sand! For the rest, what composer is there
whom you recognise as <span class='it'>great</span>—whose name rushes
on the breathless soul, and echoes through the spirit
with a sound like thunder, or the voice of Milton?
Fashions vary; tastes change. Who plays Purcell?—who
sings Arne? The musician cannot throw himself
upon that broad, unchanging instinct of popular
judgment which, after the subtleties of criticism are
exhausted and the disputes of the schools are at an
end, must decide upon questions of taste, and to
which literary creators may directly appeal. The
<span class='it'>people</span> cannot get at music to judge of it. Overtures
cannot play themselves; and the professors, whose
taste is corrupted by the over-refinements of science,
take good care that the world at large shall not hear
that great, universal music of a past age which would
sweep away their conspiracies against taste. Lightning
itself would go out of fashion, and thunder be
pronounced exploded, if you could prevent the people
from hearing them; if the learned had the playing
of them, they would swear to us that steam-guns
and rockets were more sublime. Still it is better to
compose good choruses than to write bad poetry, like
the great Frederic, or read worse, like Napoleon.
We must multiply and spin out the offices of life.
We must cram full the charge of life, if we would
have a loud report. We must coin sleep into immortality,
and mould the waste of leisure into stars of
glory. We have but one life to live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The curtain rose, but Mr. Nivernois still went on
with his harangue. There presently occurred in the
opera a passage of extraordinary beauty, and Mrs.
Althorpe began to be annoyed by the unceasing voice
behind her. Her impatience presently got the better
of her courtesy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell Mr. Thingembob there to hush,” said she to
Mr. Temple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the discourse still continued, and above the rapid
din of words could be occasionally heard, “Napoleon,”
“genius,” and “We have but one life to
live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Althorpe turned round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Nivernois, hush!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Nivernois was silent. Mrs. Althorpe relented
of her severity, and began to fear that the unfortunate
man might pine away in despair under the infliction
of her rebuke. She turned round again with
one of her most gracious smiles, and begged the
favor of his company at supper after the opera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The passage in the play struck most of the company
in the box as new; they did not remember to have
heard it at the previous representations of the opera.
The house seemed to agree with them as to its
beauty. It was called for a second and even a third
time, and the applause was loud and long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of that?” said Mrs. Althorpe
to Nivernois.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read the prophecies of Isaiah to this people,” he
replied; “if they applaud that fittingly, I should
think their praise of this worth something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments, he left the box. Presently the
leader of the orchestra came in, between the acts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I saw Mr. Nivernois here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has just gone. But where did you get that
magnificent passage you just played? It surely does
not belong to the play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are indebted to Mr. Nivernois for it. He
gave me, the other day, a mass of musical manuscripts
of his own composition. I picked this out of
them, not as being by any means the best, but the
most suited for insertion in this play. He has more
genius than all the men I have ever seen put together;
but he has abandoned composition, because he says it
is impossible to beat Bellini. The violin that I played
with to-night was presented to him by Paganini, as
a mark of his admiration; he gave it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder that he would part with such a gift,”
said Miss Stanhope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe that he gave it to me,” said the other,
“lest he should seem to himself to value the tribute
of any man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a singular person he must be!” said Miss
Stanhope, who had been much struck with his appearance,
and greatly interested by the oddness and
novelty of his character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The company which had formed Mrs. Althorpe’s
<span class='it'>cortège</span> at the opera, together with two or three other
invited guests, were seated around her small but elegant
supper-table. A double circle of wax candles
in an <span class='it'>or-molu</span> chandelier, which hung over the centre
of it, cast their pure white light upon the numerous
silver dishes and richly cut glass which covered it.
After a little while, Mr. Nivernois strode into the
room. He was a small man, and the strides which
he made were as long as himself. He took his place
in a vacant seat which had been reserved for him,
opposite to Miss Stanhope. They were talking about
Napoleon. He listened in silence, till a pause occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When nature had finished making the devils,”
said he, pouring out for himself a capacious goblet
of Chambertin, “it threw together all the rubbish
that remained, and out of it formed Napoleon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Stanhope laughed. “Do you mean that for
praise or censure, Mr. Nivernois?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Napoleon’s soul,” he replied, “was something
larger than to be enkernelled in the shell of any definition.
Put together all the moral epithets the lexicons
furnish, of wisdom and of folly, of greatness and
of littleness, of magnanimity and meanness, force
and feebleness, and every thing else, and fling the
whole mass, in a lump, at his character, and you
may have some chance of hitting the mark. It
would be difficult to say anything of him that would
be wholly false; impossible to say anything altogether
true. When you have circumnavigated him,
you have sailed round the whole world. His character
was somewhat like the poet’s vision of the temple
of Fame. On one side you behold the severe and
classic beauty of a Doric front, with images of antique
strength and grace: on another, the grandeur
and the gloom of a Gothic structure: on a third, the
pride and splendor and magnificent exaggeration of
Eastern pomp: on the fourth, the dull, impenetrable
mystery of Egypt. His spirit was as various as the
morning sky, and his chamberlain, on two successive
days, never woke up the same man. The truth is,
his life was an acted drama; not of the Æschylus
kind, with some unity in it, but a Nat Lee drama of
five-and-twenty acts. If we take it that he displayed
his sincere character, and was that which he appeared
to be, we must conclude that he was a glorious
fool, among greater fools; a madman, whose frenzy
was, however, the fatality of Europe. So viewed, he
was born for bombast, as a trout for rising; his sentences
have not a grain of sense to five quarts of syllables;
a fortunate adventurer, who appeared at such
a conjuncture of politics that his daring served him
for talent, his selfishness for sagacity, his passion for
power. But I suppose that Bonaparte always wore
the buskin; that the historical Napoleon was but a
character which the real one put on to dazzle and delude
the fancies of men, and fire their passions, till,
drunk as with wine, they might be bound and led by
him. In his own more actual being, he was a cold,
calculating, shrewd and wholly interested schemer.
His performances were always for the author’s benefit.
This Garrick sometimes blundered in the assumed
characters in which he spent his life. He too
frequently mistook ferocity for majesty; imagined
he was royal when he was only brutal, and thought
he was playing the hero when he was only playing
the fool. He assumed the madman, generally, when
he dealt with men, and only put on the blackguard
when he talked to women. He knew the truth of
Bacon’s saying that there is in human nature more
of the fool than of the wise, and that that which addresses
itself to the foolish part of men’s minds will
prevail over that which speaks to the wiser. He
built a great temple of delusion, in which he, the
priest, should continually shout “Glory,” and all
the people answer “Amen.” His breast was a natural
mirror and antitype of all the passions and follies
of the fools called Frenchmen. By studying his
own foolishness, he knew what ropes to pull to make
their fool’s bells jingle. He is, therefore, of the
weaknesses and worser powers of men, the ablest
metaphysician that has appeared. One of his remarks
opens the mind, as snuff opens the head. He
was a poet in practice. Sydney’s rule, “Fool! look
into thy heart and write,” he obeyed; and wrote empires.
Of course, an adventitious power like this
cannot be measured; in fact, when supplied by so
seething a fancy and so combining an intellect as he
had, it is altogether illimitable; he had only to conceive
a new idea to possess a new power. He therefore
belongs to that class of men of whom Du Quesnay
has said that one and one make a hundred and
eleven. When you can define the genius of Shakspeare,
you will be able to describe the <span class='it'>character</span> of
Napoleon; the two things are cognate. As we see
him, he was not an entity, but a mere crystallization
of ideas, which were continually depositing around
him like the successive layers of an oyster shell. A
philosophical Haüy might split off crystal after crystal
of ideas, and he would find the ultimate crystal
still an idea. Every thing of him was visionary, and
not substance. Squeeze him in your hand, and he
crushes like a dandy’s locks. Try that process on
such a man as Wellington, and you soon feel the
bone. In sooth, the Duke is all bone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you would not think of comparing Wellington
and Napoleon,” said Mr. Temple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more than I would compare the frothy forms
of the rock with the granite substance of the Alps.
There are some sentiments,” said he, with a fervent,
suppressed tone, “which lie so deep within us that
they seem to be a part of our souls; in me, veneration
of Wellington is such. Since the Duke of Marlborough
was buried, there has not lived, nor lives
there, a man to whom I bow with an entire reverence,
excepting Wellington. When I stood face to face
with him, I felt how truly Scott had said that he was
the only man in whose presence he felt himself nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do you think that he has Bonaparte’s genius?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not; but where you see a man who is
great without genius, you see the greatest kind of
man the world knows any thing of; and where you
see a poet who prevails without passion, you see an
order of poetry high and enduring; such, on the one
hand, is Wellington; on the other, Pope. All that such
men do is done by force of intellect and might of character,
and the results are true and permanent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt the Duke is a great man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A greater there never lived. It is the misfortune
of this age that it has no guides or leaders; no profound,
thinking men, who, knowing the past and
caring for the future, can judge rightly of the present,
and give laws to the opinions of the time. Now, the
multitude decide on every thing for themselves; and
every thing is despised which is beyond the taste of
the vulgar. Napoleon was essentially a hero for the
vulgar; fools, who have no idea of power but in tumult,
or of strength but in struggle, cannot comprehend
the calm, unapproachable grandeur of Wellington—a
grandeur too high for sympathy. I have
studied him in his despatches; I have talked with
him—I have seen him all round—there is in that
man more of innate, imperturbable greatness than in
all the world beside. When Napoleon was about to
strike a blow, he raised up around him a cloud, a
very tempest, of passions and fancies, through which
every thing was magnified and mistaken. Wellington
goes to work plainly, indifferently, frigidly, and
it is only by the result that you recognise <span class='it'>in scena
Roscium</span>. In the deep perturbation which came over
the spirit of Napoleon when he essayed any vast
work: in the mighty effort, the tremendous strain—inevitably
successful though it may have been—you
see one whose undertakings are above his nature;
who must lash his energies to make them efficient
enough. In the cool, common-place, regular, business-like
proceedings of Wellington—never erring or
unprosperous—we behold one whose native, unalterable
strength is so high that the loftiest enterprise is
to him not exciting; who, in conquering glory, is
doing his ordinary work. His trade was to be always
successful, and he was perfect master of it. There
is the same difference between the two that there is
between the youth and manhood of genius: in the
former, more fervor and greater consciousness of
power; in the latter, far more real might. The distinction
may be marked by the names of the two demons
who, in Æschylus, bind Prometheus to the
rock; one was Force, the other Strength. There is
the same diversity which exists between the calm,
grey light of the sun, and the lurid, flashing, noisy
brilliance of fire-works. Wellington is the representative
of the genius of England, which, from the
beginning of history, bearing aloft the standard of
integrity, good sense and solid freedom, has stood
like a rock in the sea of human passions and powers:
one while baffling the frantic tyranny of the Papacy,
and at another stamping under its iron heel the struggling
fiend of Jacobinism. Napoleon is the type of
France—a nation which has no power save of paroxysms,
and cannot cease to be frivolous but by becoming
ferocious. Wellington rides through life like
a Tartar horseman, with one perpetual posture, that
of the lance in rest; with one fixed gaze, that on the
object of his attack. Napoleon scoured through his
existence like a monkey on a circus horse, brandishing
a flag, stooping over his nag’s head or under his
body, jumping down to jump up again, and all to
gain the wonder and applause of the spectators;
going round and round, and ending where he began.
I must finish the parallel by saying that his course
was marked out for him by the whip of a base necessity.
Napoleon was the slave and courtier of opinion,
which he at length flattered into the belief that it
was a master. Wellington despised and neglected
opinion, till it has come fawning about his feet.
Vanity had grasped Napoleon by the throat, and he
was her garlanded victim. You never see in Wellington
that sycophancy to circumstances, that obsequiousness
to fortune. He seized Destiny by the
collar, and fairly swung her round. Consider the
wonderful, sublime achievement of Assaye; study
the political skill which he displayed in the Peninsula,
the miraculous combination of ingenuity, temper,
firmness and authority by which he threw order into
a chaos of difficulties, and, himself alone, sustained a
world of jarring interests; contemplate the glorious
action of the Arapeiles, of which Austerlitz was a
dull and broken reflection; ponder the campaign of
Torres Vedras, the master-piece of art, the wonder
of history—a conception as felicitous as the brightest
of Newton’s, and executed with a perfection
which delights the observer even to mirthfulness—a
model of <span class='it'>beauty</span> in war, by which victory was reduced
to certainty, and war became one of the exact
sciences: review these, and tell me by what proofs
of intellectual power in Napoleon’s history they are
exceeded. Remember, too, that of all Wellington’s
doings we have unvarnished and exact accounts;
while of Napoleon’s actions we have in many cases
only the statements of himself, the most enormous
liar that ever breathed the upper air. Wellington
was a great man; Napoleon was a child, who, by the
despair of an infinite and hopeless ambition, had
strengthened himself into a giant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is this remarkable consideration in Wellington’s
case, that the whole of his wide and free
career was wholly run within the limits of duty. In
that respect, no man in history may be compared
with him, except Belisarius. What such men do is
done without the inspiration of the passions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes: when a man flings himself free from all human
ties, and is self-hurled into the infinite abandonment
of the lusts of the mind, his soul becomes
charged with the might and the magnificence of all
the fires of Hell. The infernal saints all minister
their power to his spirit:—Vanity, with its craving eyes—Pride,
with its vaulting restlessness—the steel-tipped
thongs of Ambition, the fiendish vigor of Despair.
It was a dangerous thing to conquer Napoleon;
he recoiled from defeat with the spring of a demon.
When you remember that Wellington had neither
this power, which was possessed by Alexander and
Gustavus and Napoleon, nor yet the religious enthusiasm
of Cromwell, but did all by the natural and
native strength of his ordinary intellect, you must
yield him a respect which the others cannot share.
He has considered that, in politics as in geometry, the
shortest line is the straightest. Napoleon was made
up of artifice, of which Mirabeau has said that it may
indicate intellect, but it never exists in intellect of a
superior order, unless accompanied with meanness of
heart; it is a lie in action, and it springs from fear and
personal interest, and consequently from meanness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure, the moral eminence of the men will
bear no comparing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Persons of great souls and lofty meditations recognise
the dignity of nature even in the degradation
of fate. They are conscious of its great origin, its
mournful condition, its high destiny; henceforth
there is for them no scorn, but a sympathising tolerance,
a respectful compassion. Napoleon’s moral
power was the power of ferocious contempt; it was
based upon a disdainful hatred of his species. Depend
upon it, that no thinking man can cherish an
habitual disgust who has himself a soul, or abhor his
fellows who has any self-respect. You find in Wellington
none of these wild, these savage sentiments,
these extremenesses of counsel or of motive. He is
always sane, practical, right-hearted and right-minded.
His actions illustrate that useful wisdom which
the affairs of life demand, and I know no writer from
whom so valuable precepts may be learned. In or
out of Oxford, he has been the hardest student of his
times; for the saddle is, after all, the true chair of
thought. As for Napoleon being great, it seems to
me that the idea is an absurdity. Alfred, William
the Conqueror, Charlemagne, these were great men;
and such men build up all that is built, and the history
of a nation from their time till you come to another
great man, is only the record of pulling down
what they built up. But Napoleon pulled down
everything, and built up nothing. He built, to be
sure, ideally or in opinion; that is, he made systems
and structures and constitutions, on paper, notionally,
and by name, but not in things, in substance, of the
elements of real existence; else by a word, or a reversed
look, they could not have been destroyed.
What the hand creates, only the thousand hands of
Time can destroy; what the breath makes, a breath
obliterates, for the thing made was no more than a
breath. Draw a line around certain states on the
map, and call it the confederation of the Rhine; give
geographical nicknames to a quantity of soldiers, and
call it an aristocracy: behold the creations of Napoleon!
Alfred established tithings, hundred courts
and county courts; that principle of self-government—for
the administration of law is the most important
part of government—that little flame, shrined
in those humble vestal temples, and there kept safe
against the blasts of ages of tyranny’s turbulence,
blazed up eight centuries later, and wrapt the throne
of Charles in combustion. Plantaganet kings might
call their system an absolute monarchy; the Tudors
and Stuarts might diffuse the idea of divine right;
but Alfred, by establishing juries and the common
law, had made the <span class='it'>thing</span> republic, and that was sure
to beat down the <span class='it'>name</span>, monarchy. Call you a man
great whose life-work is swept away in half an hour,
without any principle of re-action or re-establishment
showing itself? Nay, his works always carried with
them the germ of their own destruction. The light
that shone around his system was the phosphorescence
of decay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This much,” said Mr. Temple, “may be said for
Napoleon, that he raised himself to absoluteism without
degrading others to slavery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, ’tis a monkey’s trick to mount up on people’s
heads. Richelieu got there, as a man does;
not by walking up men’s backs, but by making them
stoop for him to get on. In effect, the true and
bright view of Napoleon’s empire is, to consider it a
democracy. Viewed as a monarch, rising and reigning
in a constitution fashioned after the old forms, he
was a mountebank and an impostor; considered as
the controlling spirit in a democracy of powerful
spirits, the head-idea in a nation—tumult of ideas—the
odd man who is pushed up in a crowd of men—he
becomes a spectacle of wonder, a riddle of infinite
wisdom. The last of the old system, he is nothing;
the first of a new one, everything. Regarded as the
type of that democratic system which will overrun
the world, his empire is a splendid, infinitely-crowded
rehearsal of the coming drama of ages. He who
would understand the whole nature, power and philosophy
of democracy, must study that empire. Many
thoughts belong to that subject. But I have harangued
too long. Pitt was the man who said with
absolute truth, that Napoleon was “the child and
champion of democracy.” The spectacle of the force
of old monarchy in the person of the stern, iron
duke, slowly advancing and destroying this young
system, is the picture of the gloomy Saturn relentlessly
devouring his joyous giant-boys. The Jupiter
of that old deity nestles yet a babe near his bosom;
his begetting was in Pitt’s time, his birth at the Reform
Bill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Napoleon must certainly be tried by new principles
of judgment. The maxims upon which the fame
of Turenne and Marlboro’ has been settled, will not
give him his true position.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Napoleon made glory according to a receipt of
his own. But the misfortune is, that he not only imposed
this false stuff upon us, but he revolutionized
the chemistry by which its spuriousness should be
detected. He depraved the opinions, and bent backwards
the consciences of people. But upon the
whole, I think we may say, that in life, the most
beautiful of the fine arts, his taste was anything but
classical. He belonged to the David school, and
painted on the canvass of Time, such pictures as that
man hung up in the Louvre—bombast conceptions,
executed in the daub. But after all he was a splendid
creature; he made a glorious pastime in Europe;
he showed the world a magnificent sport; he filled
the pages of history with matter which possessed an
endless interest. Strike out his career, and what
blankness remains! The truth is, this life of ours is
enveloped in endless coverings, coats, over-coats and
blankets of common-place—an atmosphere of common-place,
dull, dense, unbreathable—a waking, inlaid
with sleep—life overlaid with death. Walled in,
and under-buried in a mass of tedium, one cannot get
one’s breath. Sometimes, the world becomes intensely
conscious of this imprisonment, and goes
mad in trying to get free from itself. What wonder,
if suffocated by being wrapped in a dun, drowsy,
over-growing thraldom of common-place—its eye
sick with sameness, its ear vexed with a cracked
monotony, its soul should grow convulsive, become
volcanic, and throwing off the whole disgusting encumbrance
of the social system, it should rush forth
to the free wilderness where it may once more see
the fresh, eternal stars, and breathe a living air. And
we must thank Napoleon for his battles; for war is
the glory of our disgraced existence. Struggle is the
parent of all the greatness of our being. It is only
when minds wrestle in the energy of desperation with
other minds, or with things, as in war, that the last
degrees of intellectual and moral power are seen.
The literary man goes half to sleep, and keeps awake
only enough to purr his satisfaction at his demi-unconsciousness.
In this world we must fight even to keep
ourselves alive. The politicians of this piping time
doze away their days as if they had a hundred existences
to enjoy: as if life were a chair to loll in, a
corridor to walk, or a hall to dance in, and not a general
battle-field on which to fight for everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was that in the appearance and manner of
Mr. Nivernois—his eye, his glowing countenance,
the intense life which there was about him,
rendered amiable by an entire simplicity of spirit—which
was admirably adapted to captivate the heart
and fancy of a woman, especially an enthusiastic
one. What effect had been produced upon the imaginative
temperament of Miss Stanhope, we cannot
say. As she was going away, Mrs. Althorpe said to
her,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Mr. Nivernois is certainly a man of genius,
but he is mad, stark mad—like Mazeppa’s steed—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='line0'>With spur and bridle undefiled.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>But he has blood and fortune. I sincerely wish you
would take him in hand and tame him: he is worthy
of your attention, and if properly brought under,
would make a great addition to good society.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day Nivernois was walking in the street
and had his attention attracted by a sign-board,
which gave notice of a gallery of pictures. Having
nothing better to do, he went into it. The collection
was a good one, and he spent some time in looking
at different productions of the old masters. The
feeling which chiefly occupied his mind was regret
that genius so exalted as many of these artists possessed
should have left no monument more durable
than a perishing canvass, which would one day cause
all that marvellous skill to be nothing but a name.
His eye was presently drawn to a portrait of a young
lady of singular beauty. The picture was a fresh
one, and he thought that he had seen the features
before, but where or when, he could not remember.
The side of the figure was presented, with the face
turned round over the shoulder towards the spectator.
Her dress was blue; a laced veil was on
her head, and in her hand a <span class='it'>bouquet</span> of flowers,
around which was a band on which was the word
“<span class='sc'>Love</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful creature!” said he aloud, as he gazed
upon the portrait, “and whom do you love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thee,” faintly said a soft voice above him. He
started and looked up. There was a gallery above,
and upon it a door covered by a curtain. He saw the
curtain move as if some one retreated rapidly through
it, and he thought that he had caught a glimpse of a
blue dress. He ran rapidly up to the gallery and
through the curtained door, in hopes of discovering
the speaker, perhaps the original of the portrait. He
searched every apartment of the building, but in vain:
no one was to be found. He returned to the picture
and sat down before it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love!” said he, “what is that? I never thought
of it before.” The portrait hung near to an open
door, through which the soft air of spring was bearing
the enchanting odour of a bed of violets which
grew in the garden: above was the rich softness of
the blue sky. As he sat amid influences so soothing,
and gazed upon the overpowering beauty of those
splendid features, on which a hazy sunlight coming
through a window in the roof, threw a more peculiar
lustre there arose within the stern, constrained, and
wholly intellectual being of this earnest, scheming
man, the slow but strong movement of a passion
which he never before had known. The rigid stress
of mind, so long kept up—the high-wound force of
feeling, so necessary, yet so painful—softened and
melted away in the delicious mildness of sentiment
that flowed in upon his nature. It wrestled, did that
sentiment, with the cold hardness of that logical
frame of being, as the still growing wind with the
outer barriers of a thick forest, and gradually burst
in and wandered where it pleased. The disdainful
solitude of soul in which he had fortified himself
against a hostile world, was changing into a spirit
which fraternized with all the universe. It was the
birth of sympathy within a bosom before entirely
and fiercely personal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where has it kept so long?—this soft, this delicate
emotion?” said he. As the blue zephyr, born
amidst the depths of the sky, raises and opens out
the dried, mast-bound sail of some long-locked bark,
and floats away the vessel into seas of unknown loveliness,
so did this delicious sentiment expand and
quicken that spirituality which had before lain senseless
and collapsed. It diffused a joy and beauty like
that of the golden sunshine gleaming into a clouded
forest, flowing and flashing with an ever brightening
splendor, rolling a yellow flowerage over the mind,
vesting the trees in airy robes of silver, and spreading
through the teeming woods a mysterious troop of
shadows, the dusky-haired daughters of light. Like
the refreshing rain upon the fevered earth, there fell
upon his spirit a fragrant shower of soft hopes and
immortal dreams. The rough and hardened bough
was become a branch of leaves and fruits. He who
had dwelt ever in the outwardness of thought, first
entered the portals of the inner world of feeling: he
who had been ever passionate only to <span style='font-size:smaller'>DO</span>, recognized
a state in which to <span style='font-size:smaller'>BE</span> was bliss, to move was ecstacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such is the passionate constitution of genius that
its mental nature, “like a cloud, moves all together, if
it move at all;” the moral being of men of that
stamp, intense and entire, never conceives an idea of
character or life, but it straightway throws forth all
its energy to realize that idea in its imaginary completeness:
impelled towards evil, they dash downwards
with a frenzied force and reach a depth of
degradation at which colder sinners are astounded:
when but one aspiration dawns in their bosom, they
spring up from the shores of that gulph, and soaring
above the clouds, wave in the sparkling sun their
fresh-plumed wings with not one feather moulted:
they can mould all their thinkings in the form and
pressure of pure logic; and again their feelings will
be expanding in all the chastened feelings of luxurious
sentiments. These changes make genius a puzzle to
its companions, but delicious to itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not wonderful then if this man rose from that
seat another being. But the picture was still the
centre and object of his thoughts. Rare indeed, and
transcendant was the beauty of that countenance: a
depth of passion, and an elevation of thought were
characterized upon it, which fired the imagination of
the youth who gazed. He thought that he had seen
those features before; but where, and how? He had
a faint impression that Miss Stanhope might be the
person. But in fact, so little had he been interested in
woman before, that he had scarce paid any attention
to her appearance—had no distinct remembrance of
her face. Supposing that the voice which he had
heard had proceeded from the original of the picture,
and that it indicated that he was loved by her,
he was deeply anxious to discover who it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pulled a bell which he discovered near the door,
and there issued forth in reply from a small door, an
old gray-haired man, very tall, and bent like a
crozier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What picture is this?” said Nivernois.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s a portrait,” said the old man, with a
look of great contempt at the simplicity of the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the tone in which he shouted, it seemed that
he added deafness to his other virtues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lady,” roared the other, with increased scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True; but of what lady is it the portrait?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know;” and he began to hobble back
to his cage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it for sale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No: none of them are for sale; none of them;
not one of them:” and he closed the door behind
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nivernois walked up to the picture, took it down
from the nail, unscrewed the board behind it, and
rolling up the canvass, put it under his arm and
marched out of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he reached the street he saw a woman dressed
in blue passing round the corner. From a glimpse
which he had of her features he thought it was the
picture-lady. He darted forward, but the street
which she had turned into was vacant. There stood
a large double house at the corner, and beyond it
there was a garden wall of some length; he concluded
that she must have gone into that house. He rushed
in, and turning into the first door he came to, found
himself in an elegant drawing-room in which there
were a dozen persons paying morning visits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph! humph!” said he, as he scrutinized the
face of every woman in the circle, and found that the
object of his search was not among them. He took
up a volume that lay on the table, it was lettered
“Love.” He walked towards a grand piano which
stood open, with a piece of music on the frame.
The music was entitled “Love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love!” said he; “Love! wherever I go this
morning, it is still love. I will give you my ideas of
love.” He took off his hat, and laying down his roll
in it, seated himself before the instrument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began with some sad and heavy strains which
might express the joylessness of a breast which was
a stranger to sympathy. The music was cheerless,
monotonous, and full of startling discords. Presently
there struck into this painful turbulence a light strain
of delicious melody, like a sunbeam bursting into the
primal chaos. It extended and gathered strength,
and the disorder of the rest gradually subsided, and
melted away to give place to it. Then there arose
the most brilliant and enchanting notes that that instrument
had ever given forth; a flood of varied rapture
flowed out. It was the picture of a world of
bliss; a world whose turf was of the choicest flowers,—whose
breezes were airs from paradise,—whose
sky knew not the color of a cloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The performer turned his head round and got a
glimpse through the window of some one passing
along the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There she goes!” he exclaimed, and seizing his
hat and roll, rushed out with the same vehemence
that he had entered, leaving the company not a little
astonished at the oddity of his behaviour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he got into the street, nothing was to be seen;
“I must discover that woman,” said he; “what is life
to me, if I cannot find her? All my happiness is
garnered in her being; to enjoy my own soul, I must
possess her: to live, I must live with her. By the
bye, I must have done rather an absurd thing in going
into that house and playing on the piano, without
knowing any body. By Jove, I’ll go back and apologize.
Ah! ha! there is Mrs. Althorpe going in;
she will present me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they got into the room, the company which
had been there had gone, and the lady of the house
was sitting alone. Mrs. Althorpe called her Mrs.
Stanhope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam,” said Mr. Nivernois, “I just met an eccentric
friend of mine going out of the door, who I
imagine must have made a most unauthorized entry
into your house, in a fit of absence, and behaved in a
very ridiculous manner, when in it. In fact, he requested
me to offer on his behalf the fullest apology
for his maniacal conduct, and to beg from your courtesy
an act of oblivion. He is a harmless madman,—one
of that numerous class who are suffered by
their friends to go abroad without strait-jackets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any friend of yours,” said Mrs. Stanhope, “is
extremely welcome to come into my house at all
times; and even had the eccentricities of this gentleman
been at all objectionable, we should have been
more than compensated by the admirable display
which he made upon the piano. As a pupil of Calebrenner’s,
I consider myself something of a judge;
and I never heard so rich a strain of harmony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, as for that, I do not know that he differs
materially from any one else. Everybody carries a
Marengo, a Childe Harold, and a Sonnambula in his
blood; the only difficulty is to get them out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray, Mr. Nivernois,” said Mrs. Althorpe, with
a certain look of a high bred woman, not unmixed
with something of comic, “What is it you have under
your arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Portable bliss,—the potentiality of a happiness
beyond the dreams of one who is not a lover,—ecstasy
in a roll,—perfect delight on canvass;” and
he opened the picture and held it up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Althorpe made a sign to Mrs. Stanhope to be
silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know whose portrait it is?” said Mrs.
Althorpe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot for my life discover.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you then so much wish to find the original?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A question, truly! I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it not beautiful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is not what beautiful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The painting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot speak of these matters now. For the
moment I am at war with <span class='it'>virtû</span>. It <span class='it'>may</span> be divine—perhaps
it is so. One thing I feel—the impotence
of the artist. What he has succeeded in en-canvassing
speaks only to my soul of a more radiant loveliness—that
of motion, of thought, of heart—for
which the pencil has no outline, the pallet no dye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are an enigma, and my query is unanswered.
I will put it in another form. Is <span class='it'>she</span> not beautiful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you become possessed of the picture?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw it in the exhibition, and as they refused to
sell it to me, I cut it out and brought it away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Althorpe fell back into her chair, overpowered
by irresistible laughter at the oddness of the incident,
and the solemn gravity with which Nivernois stood
eyeing the picture. An idea occurred to her by which
she might give this matter a turn to her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot imagine, of course,” said she, “whose
portrait it is. But if you will come to my house to-night,
I shall have some young ladies there, and it is
possible that the fair original may be among them.
We shall have <span class='it'>tableaux vivants</span>, and I think you will
find it pleasant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will come with the utmost pleasure, even if the
lady be not there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when I say that the party will be pleasant,
I imply thereby an invitation to Mrs. Stanhope, who
of course can make it so. But, Mr. Nivernois, are
you not afraid that the officers of justice will be after
you for abstracting that picture?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I am only taking it to be copied; after that
I shall take it back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well! put up your roll then, and we will go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had walked some distance, Mrs. Althorpe
took leave of him, and bent her steps again
towards Mrs. Stanhope’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evening, Mr. Nivernois went to Mrs. Althorpe’s.
The <span class='it'>tableaux</span> were exhibited in the hall:
the company stood at one end, and a curtain was
drawn at the other, behind which was the frame.
They went off with great effect. The first was the
Magdalen of Corregio, a recumbent figure, “with
loose hair and lifted eye,” the light thrown strongly
upon a volume open before her. The second and
third were scenes from the Corsair. While the fourth
was preparing, Mr. Nivernois got engaged in explaining
to a person near him a new method by which
<span class='it'>tableaux</span> might be presented in a much more striking
manner, and he did not take notice of the rising of
the curtain, until he heard several of the company
exclaiming, “Beautiful!”—“how beautiful!” He
turned and beheld the very picture which he had that
day been contemplating: the glorious features, the
blue dress, the veil falling over the back, the head
turned round over the shoulder. He stepped a little
forward, and his keen eye caught the glance of the
performer; there was a momentary wavering, a blush,
the face was turned aside, and the curtain fell. Nivernois
passed into a room at the side, and hastened
towards the place where the pictures were shown.
He found three or four persons there engaged in arranging
the next performance. A door stood open in
the rear leading into a large and very elegant garden.
He looked out, and through the bright moonlight saw
among the bushes a female figure. He rushed forth;
the lady fled, but soon stopped by the limits of the
ground, turned her head round, and again presented
the living portrait of the morning. It was Miss
Stanhope. He seized her hand in both of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! glorious being!” he exclaimed, “accept the
homage of my soul. Take all the worship of my being.
I love you beyond the expression of all words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She timidly extended towards him the bouquet
which she had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me the motto with the flowers,” said he,
“and you make me the happiest of mankind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a soft consenting in her form and gestures,
though she spoke not. He pressed her to his
bosom, and kissed her glowing cheek, I do not know
how often. He took her hand and they sat down
upon a bench; a bed of violets beneath their feet, the
bright young foliage around them, and above, the
glittering moon smiling a pearly lustre on the floating
clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou art, within my soul, a birth of happiness
and peace. I have been, of all men, the most ambitious:
not as valuing the opinions of the world, for I
am not yet sunk so low; but that I might in the interest
of action and creation find some comfort to
my spirit. I have had some applause; as much as
satisfied the most craving vanity of many around me.
It wearied and fretted me unutterably, and as praise
increased, I feared to go mad with the anguish of disappointment.
In this distress of an intellect always
seeking but incapable of finding, thy gentle beauty
beamed upon my heart. It awoke therein life and a
fountain of light. Yet was it not its own light, but
the reflection of thy glorious lustre; as in the blank
waters on a starry night we recognise the impassioned
splendor of the heavens. I have placed thee within
my heart; and henceforth shall I find thee, forever,
a source of joy and a spring of inspiration.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE WHITE SQUALL.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>I was</span> standing one sultry afternoon, by the weather
railing, gazing listlessly over the schooner’s side,
and indulging in such reveries as crowd upon the
mind in our moments of idleness, when my attention
was called to the cry of the look-out that a sail was
hovering to windward; and gazing out in that direction
I was soon enabled to detect a white speck far
up on the seaboard in that quarter, bearing as much
resemblance, in the eye of an unpractised observer, to
the wing of a sea-gull, as to what we knew it really
to be—the royal of a man-of-war. In an instant
all was bustle on our decks. The men below poured
up the gangway: the skulkers came out from under
the sides of the guns; the officers gathered eagerly
in a knot abaft the mainmast; spy-glasses were put
in requisition, shrewd guesses were made respecting
the flag of the stranger, and all the curiosity which
the sight of an unknown sail produces on board a
man-of-war, was displayed in its full force amongst us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think she carries herself like a Frenchman,”
said the first lieutenant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me,” said the skipper, “but she lifts as if
she were an Englishman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could swear her to be a Hollander,” said a lieutenant,
who had served a while in the navy of the
States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And were you not all so sure,” interposed a
weather-beaten quarter-master, whose boast it was
that he had been at sea for more than forty years, “I
should say yon saucy braggart was a real Spaniard,
such as Kid would have given ten years of his life to
be alongside of, for a matter of a bell or so;” and
having delivered himself of these remarks, the old
fellow coolly turned his quid, and squirted a stream
of tobacco juice like the jet of a force-pump, over the
schooner’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any rate, gentlemen,” said the captain, “the
stranger doesn’t seem to bring down much of a breeze
with him, so that we shall have plenty of time to
form our conclusions before it becomes necessary to
act. If he should even prove to be an enemy, night
may be here before he gets within range, and under
cover of the darkness we can easily escape him. The
little <span class='sc'>Fire-Fly</span> has done too much mischief, and been
too lucky heretofore, to be lost now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day had been unusually sultry. A light breeze
had ruffled the ocean in the morning, but about two
bells in the afternoon watch the wind had died away,
and an almost dead calm had succeeded. The sea
became as flat as a mirror, its polished surface only
heaving in long gentle undulations, like the bosom of
some sleeping monster. Not a ripple broke upon its
whole extent. The sky was cloudless: the rays of
the sun, pouring almost vertically downwards, and
penetrating even through the awning overhead, heated
the deck till it became like a furnace beneath the feet.
The air was close, stifling, noisome. The men cowered
under the shade of the bulwarks, or hung panting
over the schooner’s side. The sea glowed like molten
silver. Occasionally a slight gurgling sound under
the cutwater would remind us that the deep was not
wholly motionless; but excepting this, and now and
then the feeble creaking of a block, no sound broke
the oppressive silence around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, however, a slight breeze was seen ruffling
the sea upon the seaboard; and when the wind
came up toward us, curling the ocean here and there
into mimic breakers, and when especially it swept
with refreshing coolness across our decks, we experienced
sensations of the most exquisite delight, and
such as no one can imagine, who has not felt, after a
sultry calm, the first kiss of the long-wished-for breeze.
A new life was imparted into our men. The sails
were set, and we once more began to hear the sound
of the wind in the hamper, and of the waves rushing
along our sides. It was, however, only a two-knot
breeze. Such, with but little variation, it had continued
to be up to the discovery of the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For half an hour and more after our look-outs had
detected the sail to windward, we managed to keep
away sufficiently to maintain the distance we had first
possessed. But gradually the wind freshened; the
billows began to roll their white crests over in the
sun-light; the sails strained under the press of the
breeze; and the waters, rippling loud and fast under
our bows, went plashing along our sides with a gurgling
noise, and then hissed by the rudder as they
were whirled away astern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a provoking breeze!” said Westbrook.
“Here we are at a convenient distance, as O’Shaughnessy
would say, from yonder chap, having besides
the whole night before us to plan an escape from his
clutches, and lo! a breeze springs up just when it
ought to be calm, leaving us at the mercy of our huge
friend up here, with a prospect of dangling from a
yard-arm if he turns out to be an Englishman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shure an we’ll blow ourselves out of water,”
said O’Shaughnessy himself, happening to overhear
the conclusion of Westbrook’s remark, “rayther than
do that same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And into it also, eh!” said Westbrook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Shaughnessy made no reply, but shrugging his
shoulders, the conversation dropped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strange sail had by this time been made out to
be a three-decker, and so rapidly did he gain on us
that we now counted upwards of forty guns on a side.
As the breeze freshened, moreover, his velocity increased.
Throwing out fold after fold of canvass,
until a pyramid of snowy duck rose towering above
his decks, and the water rolled in cataracts of foam
beneath his gigantic bows, he seemed determined to
overtake us before the breeze which he brought with
him could by any possibility subside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile we made every effort to escape; but
without success. The very freshness of the breeze,
owing to our comparatively light canvass, was in
favor of our adversary. In vain we threw out every
sail; in vain the ropes were hauled as taut as they
could be drawn; in vain as a last resort, our sails
were wet down even to the trucks—every endeavor
to increase our speed only appeared to weary out our
crew, without altering the relative velocity of the
two ships.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By my faith! but yonder fellow sails well,” said
the skipper, “I little thought anything that carried
canvass could come up in this style, hand over hand, to
the saucy <span class='sc'>Fire-Fly</span>. What think you, Mr. Stevens?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lieutenant shook his head, and answered,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear, sir, we shall have to choose betwixt a surrender
or a hopeless fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay—that’s true,” said the skipper, abstractedly,
“but he’s not overhauled us yet, and there’s
many a slip betwixt the cup and the lip, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray God it may be so now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time the man-of-war had come up within
long cannon-shot of the schooner, and just as the lieutenant
finished his ejaculation, the stranger luffed
beautifully up a point or two, and the next minute a
sheet of flame streamed out from one of her bow-guns,
and a shot whistling past us aloft, plunged headlong
into the sea to leeward. At the same moment a roll
of bunting shot up to the gaff of the stranger, and
slowly unrolling blew out upon the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The English cross—by all that’s holy!” ejaculated
the skipper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a dead silence of more than a minute.
Each one looked into his neighbor’s face. The captain,
with a compressed lip and a disturbed brow,
gazed, without speaking, on the man-of-war; while
the discipline of the service, as well as the sudden
knowledge of our peril, were sufficient to restrain the
officers from conversation. Directly, however, the
Englishman luffed again; another sheet of fire blazed
from her bows; and a ball, sent this time with more
certainty of aim, went through our fore topsail just
above the foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show him the bunting,” growled the captain
through his clenched teeth, “and get ready the long
gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We looked at each other in mute astonishment. I
thought of Paul Jones in a like emergency. But no
one dreamed of expostulation, even if such a thing
had been allowable from inferiors. The flag was
brought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send the bunting aloft.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The huge ensign, at the word, fluttered to the gaff,
and whipping out on the breeze, disclosed the cognizance
of the commonwealth, emblazoned on its surface.
No sooner did it unclose its folds than the
man-of-war luffed rapidly, and several points more
than at either the preceding times; while simultaneously
a sheet of continuous fire rolled along his side,
and a shower of balls, ploughing up the sea betwixt
the two vessels, fell like hail around the schooner.
At the same moment I heard a noise like rattling
thunder at my side, and looking up I saw the mainsail
coming down by the run. Quicker than thought it
lay a wreck across the schooner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are sinking,” shouted a voice. It was that of
the purser. The terror of the speaker betrayed itself
in every tone. “God have mercy on us, for we are
going down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence, fool!” sternly said the skipper, and then
raising his voice he thundered, “what have they
hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve cut away the throat halyards, and the
peak has parted with the strain,” answered the first
lieutenant, who, with Westbrook and myself had
sprung at once to ascertain the real cause of the
alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let new ropes be reeved—all hands to your
duty—let drive with the long gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old gunner had been calmly waiting until the
momentary confusion should subside; and now, with
his usual flourish, he applied the match.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hit him, by the Lord Harry—and cut down his
topsail,” ejaculated the old sea-dog in high glee, as
the stranger’s fore-topsail fell from the cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This daring bravado appeared to inflame the haughty
Englishman beyond all endurance, for, after the momentary
vacillation in his course occasioned by the
loss of so important a sail, he put his helm down again,
and without losing headway to fire any more unimportant
shot, rapidly approached us. Our fate was
now, to all appearance, sealed. We gave ourselves
up for lost. Dismal recollections of all we had
heard respecting the prison-ships of our enemy, or of
the more summary punishment of death sometimes
inflicted on our countrymen, came crowding on our
minds. We looked into each other’s faces in silence,
but, though no word was spoken, on every countenance
we read the determination of a brave man, to
die sooner than to submit. Such a resolution may
seem strange to others, but we were like men to whom
defeat is worse than death. We could not submit.
To us the horrors of a prison-ship were more appalling
than those of a grave. We were resolved, if we
could not effect an escape, to die at bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would give a year’s pay,” at length ejaculated
the skipper, but in a low tone so as not to be heard
by the crew, “if this breeze would but die away here.
We should then have a chance, however slight. But
to be cooped up like a rat in a hole—it is too bad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sentence had scarcely been concluded, when,
as if in answer to the skipper’s aspiration, the breeze
blew out in a sudden gust, and then died rapidly
away, until it had almost subsided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” said the captain, “my wish has had a magical
effect. I’ faith, we’re dropping the Englishman
already. Oh! for two hours of calm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we shall have it soon, though not for long,”
said the old quarter-master, for the first time for
nearly an hour taking a complete survey of the sky,
and shaking his head knowingly, but with something
of an ominous gesture. As he concluded his scrutiny,
he said, “there’s something brewing off here to
leeward which will make us before many hours reel
like a drunken man, or my name isn’t Jack Martingale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What mean you?” said the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve mayhap never sailed in these latitudes, or
you would have seen a hurricane afore now,” said the
quarter-master. “Well, yonder tiny cloud, down
there on the sea-board in a line with that second
ratlin, holds in itself such a capful of wind as will
drive the stoutest ship like a feather before it—ay!
or send Noah’s ark itself, which the parson says was
bigger than a fleet of ninety-fours, skimming away
swifter than a sea-gull over the seas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all turned in the direction to which the old fellow
pointed us, and sure enough, about five or six degrees
above the horizon, might be seen a small dark
insignificant looking cloud, hanging like a speck upon
the azure surface of the sky. Had we not known the
quarter-master’s superior experience, the younger
portion of our group might have discredited his prophecy.
As it was, we were almost incredulous. Yet
as we gazed on the little cloud, we noticed that it
slowly but steadily increased in size. Our attention,
however, was at this moment recalled from the signs
to leeward by the renewed demonstrations of an attack
on the part of the ninety-four.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind, during our short colloquy, I have said,
had blown fiercer than ever, and then nearly died
away. This partial calm, however, had been of short
duration. In a few minutes the breeze was seen
ruffling the sea again, from a quarter of the horizon,
however, several points to the leeward of its old position.
After blowing freshly for a few minutes this
gust too ceased. Meantime the enemy had gained
little, if anything, upon us, and no doubt fancying he
perceived the signs of unsettled weather in the sky,
and therefore wishing to bring the chase to a speedy
termination, he luffed up once more, and opened a fire
on us with his bow guns. It now become a struggle
of the most exciting character. Our mainsail had by
this time been repaired, and the time lost to the foe
in luffing nearly counterbalancing his superior sailing,
we were enabled to keep just within long cannon
shot of the Englishman, and, by maintaining this
distance, to protract our surrender until a chance ball
should happen to disable us, or night should set in to
favor our escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He gains nothing on us now, I think,” said the
skipper, “but his guns are well served. That was
truly sent,” he suddenly added, as a ball whistled by
within a few feet of his head, and then plunged into
the sea some fathoms off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there comes the breeze again,” said the lieutenant,
“how the Englishman walks up toward us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was even as he said. The breeze which, during
the last five minutes, had been chopping about the
horizon, now blowing in fitful gusts, and now dying
away into an almost perfect calm, came out, as the
lieutenant spoke, from its old quarter, and heeling the
tall ninety-four over until his coppers glanced in the
sunlight, sent him like an arrow from the string across
the deep. We could see the breeze ruffling the sea
ahead of the enemy, and keeping provokingly but a
few cables’ length in his advance for many minutes
before it reached ourselves, and when at length it
bellied out our canvass, and we began to forge along,
the man-of-war had lessened by one-third the distance
that had intervened betwixt us. As if re-inspired by
his advantage, the Englishman began to fire on us
with rapid and murderous velocity. Ball after ball
came whizzing after us, some tearing up the bulwark,
some madly splintering the hull, and more than one
cutting its terrific passage along our decks. In vain
we made the most desperate exertions to increase our
speed. The strength of the breeze was a disadvantage
against which our comparatively light canvass
could not contend. Every moment, we saw, lessened
the distance between us and the foe. It seemed madness
to contend further. Already the ninety-four was
in dreadful proximity. The schooner was becoming
terribly cut up in her hull, and it seemed a miracle
that her spars had hitherto escaped. If we should
be crippled, and we knew not but the next shot
might do it, how could we expect any mercy from
our foe? Rebels already in the eye of our pursuers
we had nothing to hope for if captured. Every one
felt this. No one therefore dreamed of a surrender.
As the wounded men were carried below, their departing
looks were directed frowningly on the enemy,—and
the last words of the dying were to conjure
their messmates never to give up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never flinch, my hearties,” ejaculated the gunner,
as one of his crew was struck by a splinter; and had
to be carried below. “Give it to ’em, for villains and
tyrants as they are. Hah! I have him in a line
there. Stand by all now,” and giving a last squint
along his piece, he applied the match, and gazing
after the shot as it went whistling away, exclaimed,
“hit him on the quarter. I wonder who’s hurt,” he
added, as a sudden commotion was seen on the
enemy’s deck; “somebody of more note than a mere
topman, I guess, or they wouldn’t be in such a flurry
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s the answer,” said Westbrook, as a ball
struck us forward, scattering the bulwark about the
deck, and killing a man outright at the gunner’s
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swab her out there,” said the imperturbable old
sea-dog, without flinching in the least, “and we’ll
revenge poor Harry Ratline. By the Lord above,
I’ll make them pay for this. Work faster, you lubberly
scoundrel,” he continued, cuffing the powder-boy.
“There, that will do. And now let’s see what
damage you’ll do, old red-mouth!” and patting his
piece familiarly, he applied the match, and stooping
on his knees after the recoil, glanced along the gun
to mark the path of his ball. It struck the ninety-four
just by the fore-chains, entering the first port
aft. It needed nothing to tell the deadly revenge of
the shot. Even amid the roar of the contest we
could almost fancy we heard the shrieks of the
wounded and dying from that fatal discharge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So intensely occupied had been every thought,
during these last few minutes, that I had not noticed
the gradual subsidence in the wind; but my attention
was at this moment aroused to it by an exclamation
of O’Shaughnessy at my side, and turning my
gaze to leeward, I saw at once the cause of his
wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How long had elapsed since we had noticed the
speck on the horizon to which the old quarter-master
had called our attention I have no means of determining;
but, owing perhaps to the rapidity with
which all the subsequent events had transpired, it
seemed to be scarcely five minutes. In that interval
a radical change had come over the heavens. The
whole of the larboard horizon was covered with a
dense black cloud, extending to the very zenith, and
spreading with incredible velocity around the seaboard
and over the vault of heaven. Even as I gazed,
the rising clouds began to encroach on the western
firmament, until only a narrow speck of sky, through
which the declining sun shone out with a ghastly lustre
was seen in that quarter of the horizon. In a
moment more the massy curtain of cloud obscured
even this opening, and nothing was seen above or
around us but the wild and ominous darkness, which,
reflected from the unruffled surface of the deep, and
struggling with the few faint gleams of light that yet
remained, wrapt everything in its own sepulchral
gloom. Never shall I forget the expression of my
companions’ faces in that death-like obscurity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind, meanwhile, had for the twentieth time
within the last hour died away, and we now lay
moving unquietly on the troubled surface of the deep.
The man-of-war was to be seen in his old position,
and as he rose and fell sluggishly in the distant
gloom, his white canvass gleaming out with sepulchral
effect through the darkness, one might almost
have fancied that the shadowy foe was some gigantic
spirit ship, hanging like an evil genius upon our
quarter. As if awed by the sudden change which
had come over the firmament, both vessels had
simultaneously ceased firing. The pause on the part
of the Englishman, however, was only momentary.
The outlines of his shadowy form were soon illuminated
by the red glare of his guns, bringing his tall
masts out in bold relief against the gloomy back-ground,
and shedding a sulphurous hue on everything
around. The sullen booming of the guns; the
ghastly light flung over the deep; the low unquiet
murmurs of the sea; and the darkness gathering
more and more terrific over the firmament and reflected
back from the sea until it seemed as colorless as
ink, made up a scene whose sublimity and horror no
pen can describe. The men looked like ghosts, as
they flitted to and fro across the decks; and on every
countenance was impressed the feelings of the awestruck
owner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cannot yonder fellow see the doom that awaits
him, unless he gives over firing, and prepares for the
squall?” said the old quarter-master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as he spoke a low hollow murmur was heard
as if coming out of the deep, which struck a nameless
terror into our hearts. It was the sure presage
of the coming hurricane. The men were already
aloft getting in the sails, but as that murmured sound
struck on the skipper’s ear, he shouted,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Loose and let run—in with every thing—lose
not a second—cut with and cut all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had hardly commenced speaking when the dark
canopy of clouds on the starboard seaboard lifted up,
as if by magic, several degrees from the horizon,
displaying a long lurid, yet sickly streak of light,
against which the surges rose and fell in bold relief.
At the same instant that low wild sound was heard
again rising out of the deep; then a hoarse murmur,
the like of which I had never listened to before, issued
from the lurid seaboard; then an ominous pause
of a moment, and only a moment, succeeded; and,
while we gazed in mute wonder on each other at
these extraordinary phenomena, a deep, smothered
rumbling sound was heard, growing rapidly nigher
and nigher, and increasing in loudness as it approached;
the sea on the starboard horizon became a mass
of foam; and, with a rushing noise, the tempest
swept down upon us, hissing, roaring, and screaming
through our rigging, as if a thousand unearthly beings
were riding by upon the blast. The men had scarcely
time to see the approaching danger, and hear the
captain’s cry,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down, for your lives, down—cut all, and slide
by the backstays,” before we were lying almost on
our beam ends, while the sea flew over us in a dense
shower of spray, almost blinding our sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard up!” thundered the skipper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a period of fearful peril. For several moments,
during the first force of the squall, we knew
not whether our little craft would right again. The
mingled roar of the wind and water meanwhile was
terrific, and sufficient of themselves to paralyze the
stoutest heart. As far as the eye could see, on every
hand, the sea was as flat as a table, and covered with
foam. The pressure of the hurricane even on our
bare poles was tremendous. Every one was forced
to grasp a rope, to keep himself from being blown
bodily overboard. At length, however, with a painful
effort, our gallant craft slowly righted, staggered
a moment uncertainly beneath the squall, and then
catching the hurricane well aft, went off like a thunderbolt
before the gale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God!” ejaculated the skipper, drawing a
long breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen!” was my silent response.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During these few last moments of thrilling suspense,
I had forgotten the Englishman altogether,
but he now recurred to my thoughts, and I looked
eagerly ahead for him. The driving spray, however,
shut out everything, except in our immediate vicinity,
from our sight. At length, however, my attention
was arrested by seeing a tall spar rising over the
mist on our lee-bow, and, rushing on to it with inconceivable
velocity, we were soon on the weather quarter
of the foe. Never shall I forget that sight. The
huge ship was lying on his beam-ends, and his
mizen-mast had already been cut away in an unsuccessful
attempt to right him. The sea rolled over
him, as we approached, in cataracts. For an instant
we gave ourselves up for lost, as we were driving
right on to the unhappy stranger. At that moment,
however, we saw his mainmast go over his side.
He righted slowly. We were now so near that I
could have pitched a biscuit on board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard up—ha-a-rd!” thundered the Englishman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Luff—luff!” roared the skipper, as we drove on
to the quarter of the foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a thrilling moment. For the space of a
second we seemed dashing right into the foe, and a
stifled shriek burst from every lip; but just as we
gave up all for lost, the two vessels shot apart,
grazed each other in passing, and then rushed like
maddened coursers each on his own course. In less
than a quarter of an hour, the foe had vanished in
the mists upon our larboard quarter.</p>

<div><h1><a id='few'></a>A FEW WORDS ON SECRET WRITING.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY EDGAR A. POE.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>As</span> we can scarcely imagine a time when there did
not exist a necessity, or at least a desire, of transmitting
information from one individual to another,
in such manner as to elude general comprehension;
so we may well suppose the practice of writing in
cipher to be of great antiquity. De La Guilletiere,
therefore, who, in his “Lacedæmon Ancient and
Modern,” maintains that the Spartans were the inventors
of Cryptography, is obviously in error. He
speaks of the <span class='it'>scytala</span> as being the origin of the art;
but he should only have cited it as one of its earliest
instances, so far as our records extend. The <span class='it'>scytala</span>
were two wooden cylinders, precisely similar in all
respects. The general of an army, in going upon
any expedition, received from the ephori one of
these cylinders, while the other remained in their
possession. If either party had occasion to communicate
with the other, a narrow strip of parchment
was so wrapped around the <span class='it'>scytala</span> that the edges of
the skin fitted accurately each to each. The writing
was then inscribed longitudinally, and the epistle
unrolled and dispatched. If, by mischance, the
messenger was intercepted, the letter proved unintelligible
to his captors. If he reached his destination
safely, however, the party addressed had only
to involve the second cylinder in the strip to decipher
the inscription. The transmission to our own
times of this obvious mode of cryptography is due,
probably, to the <span class='it'>historical</span> uses of the <span class='it'>scytala</span>, rather
than to anything else. Similar means of secret intercommunication
must have existed almost contemporaneously
with the invention of letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be as well to remark, in passing, that in
none of the treatises on the subject of this paper
which have fallen under our cognizance, have we observed
any suggestion of a method—other than those
which apply alike to all ciphers—for the solution of
the cipher by <span class='it'>scytala</span>. We read of instances, indeed,
in which the intercepted parchments were deciphered;
but we are not informed that this was ever done
except accidentally. Yet a solution might be obtained
with absolute certainty in this manner. The
strip of skin being intercepted, let there be prepared
a cone of great length comparatively—say six feet
long—and whose circumference at base shall at least
equal the length of the strip. Let this latter be
rolled upon the cone near the base, edge to edge, as
above described; then, still keeping edge to edge,
and maintaining the parchment close upon the cone,
let it be gradually slipped towards the apex. In this
process, some of those words, syllables, or letters,
whose connection is intended, will be sure to come
together at that point of the cone where its diameter
equals that of the <span class='it'>scytala</span> upon which the cipher
was written. And as, in passing up the cone to its
apex, all possible diameters are passed over, there
is no chance of a failure. The circumference of the
<span class='it'>scytala</span> being thus ascertained, a similar one can be
made, and the cipher applied to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Few persons can be made to believe that it is not
quite an easy thing to invent a method of secret
writing which shall baffle investigation. Yet it may
be roundly asserted that human ingenuity cannot
concoct a cipher which human ingenuity cannot resolve.
In the facility with which such writing is
deciphered, however, there exist very remarkable
differences in different intellects. Often, in the case
of two individuals of acknowledged equality as regards
ordinary mental efforts, it will be found that,
while one cannot unriddle the commonest cipher,
the other will scarcely be puzzled by the most abstruse.
It may be observed, generally, that in such
investigations the analytic ability is very forcibly
called into action; and, for this reason, cryptographical
solutions might with great propriety be
introduced into academies, as the means of giving
tone to the most important of the powers of mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Were two individuals, totally unpractised in cryptography,
desirous of holding by letter a correspondence
which should be unintelligible to all but themselves,
it is most probable that they would at once
think of a peculiar alphabet, to which each should
have a key. At first it would, perhaps, be arranged
that <span class='it'>a</span> should stand for <span class='it'>z</span>, <span class='it'>b</span> for <span class='it'>y</span>, <span class='it'>c</span> for <span class='it'>x</span>, <span class='it'>d</span> for <span class='it'>w</span>,
&amp;c. &amp;c.; that is to say, the order of the letters
would be reversed. Upon second thoughts, this arrangement
appearing too obvious, a more complex
mode would be adopted. The first thirteen letters
might be written beneath the last thirteen, thus:</p>

<table id='tab7' summary='' class='center'>

</table>

<p class='noindent'>and, so placed, <span class='it'>a</span> might stand for <span class='it'>n</span> and <span class='it'>n</span> for <span class='it'>a</span>, <span class='it'>o</span> for
<span class='it'>b</span> and <span class='it'>b</span> for <span class='it'>o</span>, &amp;c. &amp;c. This, again, having an air of
regularity which might be fathomed, the key alphabet
might be constructed absolutely at random.</p>

<table id='tab8' summary='' class='center'>
<tr><td class='tab8c1 tdStyle5'>Thus,</td><td class='tab8c2 tdStyle5'></td><td class='tab8c3 tdStyle5'>a might stand for p</td><td class='tab8c4 tdStyle5'></td><td class='tab8c5 tdStyle5'></td></tr>

</table>

<p class='noindent'>The correspondents, unless convinced of their error
by the solution of their cipher, would no doubt be
willing to rest in this latter arrangement, as affording
full security. But if not, they would be likely
to hit upon the plan of arbitrary marks used in place
of the usual characters. For example,</p>

<table id='tab9' summary='' class='center'>
<tr><td class='tab9c1 tdStyle5'>(</td><td class='tab9c2 tdStyle5'>&nbsp;might be employed for</td><td class='tab9c3 tdStyle5'>a</td><td class='tab9c4 tdStyle5'></td><td class='tab9c5 tdStyle5'></td></tr>

<tr><td class='tab9c1 tdStyle5'>;</td><td class='tab9c2 tdStyle5'>&nbsp;might be employed for</td><td class='tab9c3 tdStyle5'>d</td><td class='tab9c4 tdStyle5'></td><td class='tab9c5 tdStyle5'></td></tr>
<tr><td class='tab9c1 tdStyle5'>)</td><td class='tab9c2 tdStyle5'>&nbsp;might be employed for</td><td class='tab9c3 tdStyle5'>e,</td><td class='tab9c4 tdStyle5'>&amp;c.</td><td class='tab9c5 tdStyle5'></td></tr>
<tr><td class='tab9c1 tdStyle5'></td><td class='tab9c2 tdStyle5'>&nbsp;</td><td class='tab9c3 tdStyle5'>&nbsp;</td><td class='tab9c4 tdStyle5'>&nbsp;</td><td class='tab9c5 tdStyle5'>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class='noindent'>A letter composed of such characters would have an
intricate appearance unquestionably. If, still, however,
it did not give full satisfaction, the idea of a
perpetually shifting alphabet might be conceived,
and thus effected. Let two circular pieces of pasteboard
be prepared, one about half an inch in diameter
less than the other. Let the centre of the smaller
be placed upon the centre of the larger, and secured
for a moment from slipping; while <span class='it'>radii</span> are
drawn from the common centre to the circumference
of the smaller circle, and thus extended to the circumference
of the greater. Let there be twenty-six
of these <span class='it'>radii</span>, forming on each pasteboard twenty-six
spaces. In each of these spaces on the under
circle write one of the letters of the alphabet, so that
the whole alphabet be written—if at random so much
the better. Do the same with the upper circle.
Now run a pin through the common centre, and let
the upper circle revolve, while the under one is held
fast. Now stop the revolution of the upper circle,
and, while both lie still, write the epistle required;
using for <span class='it'>a</span> that letter in the smaller circle which
tallies with <span class='it'>a</span> in the larger, for <span class='it'>b</span> that letter in the
smaller circle which tallies with <span class='it'>b</span> in the larger, &amp;c.
&amp;c. In order that an epistle thus written may be
read by the person for whom it is intended, it is only
necessary that he should have in his possession circles
constructed as those just described, and that he
should know any two of the characters (one in the
under and one in the upper circle) which were in
juxta-position when his correspondent wrote the
cipher. Upon this latter point he is informed by
looking at the two initial letters of the document,
which serve as a key. Thus, if he sees <span class='it'>a m</span> at the
beginning, he concludes that, by turning his circles
so as to put these characters in conjunction, he will
arrive at the alphabet employed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a cursory glance, these various modes of constructing
a cipher seem to have about them an air of
inscrutable secresy. It appears almost an impossibility
to unriddle what has been put together by so
complex a method. And to some persons the difficulty
might be great; but to others—to those skilled
in deciphering—such enigmas are very simple indeed.
The reader should bear in mind that the basis
of the whole art of solution, as far as regards these
matters, is found in the general principles of the formation
of language itself, and thus is altogether
independent of the particular laws which govern any
cipher, or the construction of its key. The difficulty
of reading a cryptographical puzzle is by no
means always in accordance with the labor or ingenuity
with which it has been constructed. The sole
use of the key, indeed, is for those <span class='it'>au fait</span> to the
cipher; in its perusal by a third party, no reference
is had to it at all. The lock of the secret is picked.
In the different methods of cryptography specified
above, it will be observed that there is a gradually
increasing complexity. But this complexity is only
in shadow. It has no substance whatever. It appertains
merely to the formation, and has no bearing
upon the solution, of the cipher. The last mode
mentioned is not in the least degree more difficult to
be deciphered than the first—whatever may be the
difficulty of either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the discussion of an analogous subject, in one
of the weekly papers of this city, about eighteen
months ago, the writer of this article had occasion
to speak of the application of a rigorous <span class='it'>method</span>
in all forms of thought—of its advantages—of the
extension of its use even to what is considered the
operation of pure fancy—and thus, subsequently, of
the solution of cipher. He even ventured to assert
that no cipher, of the character above specified,
could be sent to the address of the paper, which he
would not be able to resolve. This challenge excited,
most unexpectedly, a very lively interest
among the numerous readers of the journal. Letters
were poured in upon the editor from all parts of
the country; and many of the writers of these epistles
were so convinced of the impenetrability of their
mysteries, as to be at great pains to draw him into
wagers on the subject. At the same time, they were
not always scrupulous about sticking to the point.
The cryptographs were, in numerous instances, altogether
beyond the limits defined in the beginning.
Foreign languages were employed. Words and sentences
were run together without interval. Several
alphabets were used in the same cipher. One
gentleman, but moderately endowed with conscientiousness,
inditing us a puzzle composed of pot-hooks
and hangers to which the wildest typography of the
office could afford nothing similar, went even so far
as to jumble together no less than <span class='it'>seven distinct alphabets</span>,
without intervals between the letters, <span class='it'>or between
the lines</span>. Many of the cryptographs were
dated in Philadelphia, and several of those which
urged the subject of a bet were written by gentlemen
of this city. Out of, perhaps, one hundred
ciphers altogether received, there was only one
which we did not immediately succeed in resolving.
This one we <span class='it'>demonstrated</span> to be an imposition—that
is to say, we fully proved it a jargon of random
characters, having no meaning whatever. In respect
to the epistle of the seven alphabets, we had the
pleasure of completely <span class='it'>nonplus</span>-ing its inditer by a
prompt and satisfactory translation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weekly paper mentioned, was, for a period of
some months, greatly occupied with the hieroglyphic
and cabalistic-looking solutions of the cryptographs
sent us from all quarters. Yet with the exception
of the writers of the ciphers, we do not believe that
any individuals could have been found, among the
readers of the journal, who regarded the matter in
any other light than in that of a desperate humbug.
We mean to say that no one really believed in the
authenticity of the answers. One party averred that
the mysterious figures were only inserted to give a
<span class='it'>queer</span> air to the paper, for the purpose of attracting
attention. Another thought it more probable that
we not only solved the ciphers, but put them together
ourselves for solution. This having been the state
of affairs at the period when it was thought expedient
to decline farther dealings in necromancy, the
writer of this article avails himself of the present
opportunity to maintain the truth of the journal in
question—to repel the charges of rigmarole by which
it was assailed—and to declare, in his own name,
that the ciphers were all written in good faith, and
solved in the same spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A very common, and somewhat too obvious mode
of secret correspondence, is the following. A card
is interspersed, at irregular intervals, with oblong
spaces, about the length of ordinary words of three
syllables in a bourgeois type. Another card is
made exactly coinciding. One is in possession of
each party. When a letter is to be written, the key-card
is placed upon the paper, and words conveying
the true meaning inscribed in the spaces. The card
is then removed and the blanks filled up, so as to
make out a signification different from the real one.
When the person addressed receives the cipher, he
has merely to apply to it his own card, when the superfluous
words are concealed, and the significant
ones alone appear. The chief objection to this cryptograph
is the difficulty of so filling the blanks as
not to give a forced appearance to the sentences.
Differences, also, in the handwriting, between the
words written in the spaces, and those inscribed upon
removal of the card, will always be detected by a
close observer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pack of cards is sometimes made the vehicle of a
cipher, in this manner. The parties determine, in the
first place, upon certain arrangements of the pack.
For example: it is agreed that, when a writing is to
be commenced, a natural sequence of the spots shall
be made; with spades at top, hearts next, diamonds
next, and clubs last. This order being obtained, the
writer proceeds to inscribe upon the top card the
first letter of his epistle, upon the next the second,
upon the next the third, and so on until the pack is
exhausted, when, of course, he will have written
fifty-two letters. He now shuffles the pack according
to a preconcerted plan. For example: he takes
three cards from the bottom and places them at top,
then one from top, placing it at bottom, and so on,
for a given number of times. This done, he again
inscribes fifty-two characters as before, proceeding
thus until his epistle is written. The pack being received
by the correspondent, he has only to place
the cards in the order agreed upon for commencement,
to read, letter by letter, the first fifty-two characters
as intended. He has then only to shuffle in
the manner pre-arranged for the second perusal, to
decipher the series of the next fifty-two letters—and
so on to the end. The objection to this cryptograph
lies in the nature of the missive. <span class='it'>A pack of cards</span>, sent
from one party to another, would scarcely fail to excite
suspicion; and it cannot be doubted that it is far
better to secure ciphers from being considered as
such, than to waste time in attempts at rendering
them scrutiny-proof, when intercepted. Experience
shows that the most cunningly constructed cryptograph,
if suspected, can and will be unriddled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An unusually secure mode of secret intercommunication
might be thus devised. Let the parties each
furnish themselves with a copy of the same edition
of a book—the rarer the edition the better—as also
the rarer the book. In the cryptograph, numbers are
used altogether, and these numbers refer to the locality
of letters in the volume. For example—a cipher
is received commencing, 121-6-8. The party addressed
refers to page 121, and looks at the sixth letter
from the left of the page in the eighth line from
the top. Whatever letter he there finds is the initial
letter of the epistle—and so on. This method is
very secure; yet it is <span class='it'>possible</span> to decipher any cryptograph
written by its means—and it is greatly objectionable
otherwise, on account of the time necessarily
required for its solution, even with the key-volume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not to be supposed that Cryptography, as a
serious thing, as the means of imparting important
information, has gone out of use at the present day.
It is still commonly practised in diplomacy; and
there are individuals, even now, holding office in the
eye of various foreign governments, whose real business
is that of deciphering. We have already said
that a peculiar mental action is called into play in
the solution of cryptographical problems, at least in
those of the higher order. Good cryptographists are
rare indeed; and thus their services, although seldom
required, are necessarily well requited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An instance of the modern employment of writing
in cipher is mentioned in a work lately published by
Messieurs Lea &amp; Blanchard, of this city—“Sketches
of Conspicuous Living Characters of France.” In a
notice of Berryer, it is said that a letter being addressed
by the Duchess de Berri to the legitimists of
Paris, to inform them of her arrival, it was accompanied
by a long note in cipher, the key of which she
had forgotten to give. “The penetrating mind of
Berryer,” says the biographer, “soon discovered it.
It was this phrase substituted for the twenty-four letters
of the alphabet—<span class='it'>Le gouvernement provisoire</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The assertion that Berryer “soon discovered the
key-phrase,” merely proves that the writer of these
memoirs is entirely innocent of cryptographical
knowledge. Monsieur B. no doubt ascertained the
key-phrase; but it was merely to satisfy his curiosity,
<span class='it'>after the riddle had been read</span>. He made no use
of the key in deciphering. The lock was picked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In our notice of the book in question (published in
the April number of this Magazine) we alluded to
this subject thus—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The phrase ‘<span class='it'>Le gouvernement provisoire</span>’ is
French, and the note in cipher was addressed to
Frenchmen. The difficulty of deciphering may well
be supposed much greater, had the key been in a foreign
tongue; yet any one who will take the trouble
may address us a note, in the same manner as here
proposed; and the key-phrase may be either in
French, Italian, Spanish, German, Latin, or Greek,
(or in any of the dialects of these languages,) and
we pledge ourselves for the solution of the riddle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This challenge has elicited but a single response,
which is embraced in the following letter. The only
quarrel we have with the epistle, is that its writer
has declined giving us his name in full. We beg that
he will take an early opportunity of doing this, and
thus relieve us of the chance of that suspicion which
was attached to the cryptography of the weekly
journal above-mentioned—the suspicion of inditing
ciphers to ourselves. The postmark of the letter is
<span class='it'>Stonington, Conn.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>:—In the April number of your magazine, while
reviewing the translation by Mr. Walsh of “Sketches
of Conspicuous Living Characters of France,” you
invite your readers to address you a note in cipher,
“the key phrase to which may be either in French,
Italian, Spanish, German, Latin or Greek,” and
pledge yourself for its solution. My attention being
called, by your remarks, to this species of cipher-writing,
I composed for my own amusement the following
exercises, in the first part of which the key-phrase
is in English—in the second in Latin. As I
did not see, (by the number for May,) that any of
your correspondents had availed himself of your offer,
I take the liberty to send the enclosed, on which,
if you should think it worth your while, you can exercise
your ingenuity.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>I am yours, respectfully,</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the solution of the first of these ciphers we had
little more than ordinary trouble. The second proved
to be exceedingly difficult, and it was only by calling
every faculty into play that we could read it at
all. The first runs thus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Various are the methods which have been devised
for transmitting secret information from one
individual to another, by means of writing, illegible
to any except him for whom it was originally designed;
and the art of thus secretly communicating
intelligence has been generally termed <span class='it'>cryptography</span>.
Many species of secret writing were known to the
ancients. Sometimes a slave’s head was shaved, and
the crown written upon with some indelible coloring
fluid; after which the hair being permitted to grow
again, information could be transmitted with little
danger that discovery would ensue until the ambulatory
epistle safely reached its destination. Cryptography,
however, pure, properly embraces those modes
of writing which are rendered legible only by means
of some explanatory key which makes known the real
signification of the ciphers employed to its possessor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The key-phrase of this cryptograph is—“A word
to the wise is sufficient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second is thus translated—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsensical phrases and unmeaning combinations
of words, as the learned lexicographer would have
confessed himself, when hidden under cryptographic
ciphers, serve to <span class='it'>perpdex</span> the curious enquirer, and
baffle penetration more completely than would the
most profound <span class='it'>apothems</span> of learned philosophers.
Abstruse disquisitions of the scholiasts, were they
but presented before him in the undisguised vocabulary
of his mother tongue——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last sentence here (as will be seen) is broken
off short. The spelling we have strictly adhered to.
<span class='it'>D</span>, by mistake, has been put for <span class='it'>l</span> in <span class='it'>perplex</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The key-phrase is—“<span class='it'>Suaviter in modo, fortiter
in re</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the ordinary cryptograph, as will be seen in reference
to most of those we have specified above, the
artificial alphabet agreed upon by the correspondents,
is employed, letter for letter, in place of the usual
or natural one. For example:—two parties wish to
communicate secretly. It is arranged before parting
that</p>

<span class='it'>e</span>, <span class='it'>o</span>, <span class='it'>t</span>, <span class='it'>r</span> and <span class='it'>i</span>—the latter character greatly
predominating, through the accident of being employed
for letters which, themselves, are inordinately
prevalent in most languages—we mean
<span class='it'>e</span> and <span class='it'>i</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A letter thus written being intercepted, and the
key-phrase unknown, the individual who should attempt
to decipher it may be imagined <span class='it'>guessing</span>, or
otherwise attempting to convince himself, that a
certain character (<span class='it'>i</span>, for example,) represented the
letter <span class='it'>e</span>. Looking throughout the cryptograph for
confirmation of this idea, he would meet with
nothing but a negation of it. He would see the
character in situations where it could not possibly
represent <span class='it'>e</span>. He might, for instance, be puzzled by
four <span class='it'>i</span>’s forming of themselves a single word, without
the intervention of any other character; in which
case, of course, they could not be <span class='it'>all e</span>’s. It will be
seen that the word <span class='it'>wise</span> might be thus constructed.
We say this may be seen <span class='it'>now</span>, by us, in possession
of the key-phrase; but the question will, no doubt,
occur, how, <span class='it'>without</span> the key-phrase, and without
cognizance of any single letter in the cipher, it
would be possible for the interceptor of such a cryptograph
to make any thing of such a word as <span class='it'>iiii</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But again. A key-phrase might easily be constructed,
in which one character would represent
seven, eight, or ten letters. Let us then imagine
the word <span class='it'>iiiiiiiiii</span> presenting itself in a cryptograph
to an individual <span class='it'>without</span> the proper key-phrase; or, if
this be a supposition somewhat too perplexing, let us
suppose it occurring to the person for whom the
cipher is designed, and who <span class='it'>has</span> the key-phrase.
What is he to do with such a word as <span class='it'>iiiiiiiiii</span>? In
any of the ordinary books upon Algebra will be
found a very concise <span class='it'>formula</span> (we have not the necessary
type for its insertion here) for ascertaining
the number of arrangements in which <span class='it'>m</span> letters may
be placed, taken <span class='it'>n</span> at a time. But no doubt there
are none of our readers ignorant of the innumerable
combinations which may be made from these ten
<span class='it'>i</span>’s. Yet, unless it occur otherwise by accident, the
correspondent receiving the cipher would have to
write down all these combinations before attaining
the word intended; and even when he had written
them, he would be inexpressibly perplexed in selecting
the word designed from the vast number of other
words arising in the course of the permutation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To obviate, therefore, the exceeding difficulty of
deciphering this species of cryptograph, on the part
of the possessors of the key-phrase, and to confine
the deep intricacy of the puzzle to those for whom
the cipher was not designed, it becomes necessary
that some <span class='it'>order</span> should be agreed upon by the parties
corresponding—some order in reference to
which those characters are to be read which represent
more than one letter—and this <span class='it'>order</span> must be
held in view by the writer of the cryptograph. It
may be agreed, for example, that the <span class='it'>first</span> time an <span class='it'>i</span>
occurs in the cipher, it is to be understood as representing
that character which stands against the <span class='it'>first
i</span> in the key-phrase; that the <span class='it'>second</span> time an <span class='it'>i</span> occurs
it must be supposed to represent that letter which
stands opposed to the <span class='it'>second i</span> in the key-phrase,
&amp;c. &amp;c. Thus the <span class='it'>location</span> of each cipherical letter
must be considered in connexion with the character
itself, in order to determine its exact signification.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We say that some pre-concerted <span class='it'>order</span> of this
kind is necessary, lest the cipher prove too intricate
a lock to yield even to its true key. But it will be
evident, upon inspection, that our correspondent at
Stonington has inflicted upon us a cryptograph in
which <span class='it'>no</span> order has been preserved; in which many
characters, respectively, stand, at absolute random,
for many others. If, therefore, in regard to the
gauntlet we threw down in April, he should be half
inclined to accuse us of braggadocio, he will yet admit
that we have <span class='it'>more</span> than acted up to our boast.
If what we then said was not said <span class='it'>suaviter in modo</span>,
what we now do is at least done <span class='it'>fortiter in re</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these cursory observations we have by no means
attempted to exhaust the subject of Cryptography.
With such object in view, a folio might be required.
We have indeed mentioned only a few of the ordinary
modes of cipher. Even two thousand years
ago, Æneas Tacticus detailed twenty distinct methods;
and modern ingenuity has added much to the
science. Our design has been chiefly suggestive;
and perhaps we have already bored the readers of
the Magazine. To those who desire farther information
upon this topic, we may say that there are
extant treatises by Trithemius, Cap. Porta, Vignere,
and P. Niceron. The works of the two latter may
be found, we believe, in the library of the Harvard
University. If, however, there should be sought in
these disquisitions—or in any—<span class='it'>rules for the solution</span>
of cipher, the seeker will be disappointed. Beyond
some hints in regard to the general structure
of language, and some minute exercises in their
practical application, he will find nothing upon record
which he does not in his own intellect possess.</p>

<div><h1><a id='spo'></a>SPORTS AND PASTIMES.—ANGLING.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> natural history of Fishes may be greatly promoted by
anglers, and some knowledge of that history assuredly adds
interest to the pursuits of the sportsman. He ought, therefore,
to be able to skin and prepare his specimens, to observe
and describe them with precision, and to dissect them
with sufficient skill to take cognizance both of their external
parts and their internal structure. Every naturalist, on
the other hand, should be an angler, and that for more reasons
than one. In the remoter and less peopled districts of
the country, which so frequently present the most interesting
fields for observation, he has no means of inspecting the
finny tribes, except by capturing them <span class='it'>propriâ manû</span>, and
his doing so will greatly contribute, not only to his scientific
knowledge, but his social comfort—trouts when newly angled
and nicely fried, being worthy of admiration, as choice
productions of nature adorned by the skill of art. But this
latter branch of our subject comes so home to the “business
and bosoms” of all men, that we need not here dilate upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the hope, however, that some useful knowledge may be
conveyed to the minds of our readers through the medium
of the present work, we intend to devote a portion of our
space to a brief introduction regarding the organic structure
and physiology of fishes. We know, from experience, that
time may hang heavy even on the hands of anglers, who are
seldom either feeble or faint-hearted men. We know that
spring (all genial though it be in poet’s fancy) has yet its
frequent flaky snows on mead and mountain, its spiky ice
along the crystal stream;—that summer in its sunlit splendor
suffers its long-enduring droughts, its sudden <span class='it'>speats</span>,
and fearful overflows;—that melancholy autumn, in spite
of all its mild effulgence, is not seldom violent, and perturbed</p>

<p class='line0'>“By lightning, by fierce winds, by trampling waves;”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>—and that each of these conditions of time and space is adverse
to the angler’s art. Even with every sweet advantage
yielded by cheerful spring, by glorious summer, by refulgent
autumn (we now seek to soothe the seasons by more
endearing terms), daylight does not last for ever, and so the
angler cannot always ply his trade. Of night-fishing we
seldom think—except in murmuring dreams of rheumatism
and water-rats—and eye-sight often fails,</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, it is chiefly the home-hunting angler, he whose
“lines have fallen in pleasant places,” who dwells habitually
by river side, or sees “beneath the opening eyelids of morn”
some broad lake gladdening his daily gaze—in moonlight
sparkling with bright columnar fire within its cincturing
trees, or greener margins—he, or some happy friend who
shares his dwelling, alone can cast his angles in the night.
No man, who “long in populous city pent,” wanders for a
time in lonesome gladness by the side of glittering waters,
can wait with patience for a summer night, however beautiful
may be the countless stars—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether he will or no, he must wend his way to grassy
bank, or pebbly shore, or alder-skirted brink, and if there he
fishes all the live-long day, he cannot fish at night, at least
he ought not so to do. He who spareth not the rod hateth
himself, and produces a degree of fatigue and satiety which
ought never to mingle with his healthful toil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suppose, then, that the gentle reader does not fish at night,
that he dines heartily (<span class='it'>sero sed serio</span>), imbibes moderately,
takes tea sedately, and has still an hour to spare before a
light supper—let him read this article, and we promise to
be as little prolix as we can.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE PERCH.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>This gregarious fish is angled for with a worm or minnow.
It is a bold biter during the warm months of the year,
though very abstemious in the winter season. When a shoal
is met with, great sport is frequently obtained. A small
cork float is used, and the bait is hung at various depths,
according to circumstances, a knowledge of which can only
be obtained by practice. In angling near the bottom, the
bait should be frequently raised nearly to the surface, and
then allowed gently to sink again. When the weather is
cool and cloudy, with a ruffling breeze from the south, perch
will bite during the whole day. The best hours towards the
end of spring are from seven to eleven in the morning, and
from two to six in the afternoon. In warm and bright summer
weather, excellent times are from sunrise till six or
seven in the morning, and from six in the evening till sunset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Perch is one of the most beautiful of the fresh water
fishes, but is too familiarly known to need description. It
inhabits both lakes and rivers, but shuns salt water. Pallas,
however, is said to have stated in his <span class='it'>Zoographia Russo-Asiatica</span>
(a work still unpublished), that about spawning
time both Pike and Perch are found in a gulf of the Caspian
Sea, about thirty verstes from the mouth of the Terek. The
female deposits her eggs, united together by a viscid matter,
in lengthened strings—a peculiarity noticed by Aristotle.
Spawning takes place in April and May, and the number of
eggs sometimes amounts to near a million. The Perch occurs
all over Europe, and in most of the northern districts
of Asia. It is easily tamed, and if kept moist will live for a
long time out of water. It sometimes attains to a great size,
but the majority are smallish fishes. Pennant alludes to one
said to have been taken in the Serpentine River, Hyde
Park, which weighed nine pounds. But even one half of
that weight would be anywhere regarded as extraordinary,
and a Perch of a pound is looked upon as a fine fish. The
flesh of this species as an article of food is wholesome,
though neither rich nor high flavoured. The months of
April, May, and June, are those during which it is least
esteemed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Basse, or Sea Perch, (<span class='it'>Perca labrax</span>, Linn. <span class='it'>Labrax
lupus</span>, Cuv. and Val.) is a fish of a chaste and pleasing
aspect, though destitute of the strongly contrasted coloring
of the preceding, from which it is also distinguished by an
abundance of small teeth upon the tongue. It is abundant
in the Mediterranean. It is a very voracious fish, remarkable
for the size of its stomach, and was known to the ancients
by the appropriate name of <span class='it'>lupus</span>. It takes a bait
freely (<span class='it'>onisci</span>, broken shell-fish, etc.) when angled for during
flood-tide, with strong tackle, from projecting rock or pier.
The ordinary size ranges from 12 to 18 inches, although
Willoughby has stated that it sometimes attains the weight
of 15 pounds. Its flesh is excellent.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>EXTERNAL FORM AND ATTRIBUTES OF FISHES.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>To aid the Angler in his scientific researches, as well as
to add to the interest of the ordinary observer, we now proceed
to a brief exposition of the principal characteristics of
the <span class='it'>class</span> of fishes, and shall, at an after period, expatiate
upon the more peculiar attributes of each particular kind,
when we come to treat of the <span class='it'>species</span> in their order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We need scarcely say to the student of nature, that the
form and functions of fishes are as admirably adapted for
easy movement through the water, as are those of birds for
that aërial motion called flight. Suspended in a liquid element
of almost equal specific gravity with themselves, external
organs resembling those of birds in size, would have
been disproportionate and unnecessary; but the air-bladder
(the functions of which, by no means entirely understood,
have never been satisfactorily explained in all their bearings)
is known to possess the power of contraction and dilatation,
the exercise of which is followed by a corresponding
descent or ascent of the animal’s body. Thus a small central
and inconspicuous organ effects, in the easiest and most
simple manner, the same object which even the soaring
eagle or giant condor can only accomplish by great exertion
of the wings, and after laborious and frequently repeated
gyrations. We shall ere long, however, have occasion to
remark in more detail, that the air-bladder, although essential
to the economy of such species as possess it, is by no
means indispensable as a general attribute of the class, as in
many tribes it is entirely wanting. It is not even a generic
characteristic, as it does not exist in the red mullets of the
British seas, though possessed by the corresponding species
of Asia and America—while of our two kinds of mackerel,
the so called Spanish species (<span class='it'>Scomber colias</span>) is distinguished
by a swimming bladder, and the common mackerel
(<span class='it'>Sc. scomber</span>) does not possess that organ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fishes being without a neck, and the portion called the
tail being usually equal at its origin to the part of the body
from which it springs, the prevailing shape is somewhat
uniform and continuous, diminishing gradually towards
either extremity. Of this, the most elegant and characteristic
form of fishes, the salmon and mackerel exhibit familiar
examples. Yet a vast variety of shape, as well as of size
and colour, is naturally presented by a class which now contains
some seven or eight thousand known species; and no
further illustration of the subject will be deemed necessary
by him who has seen and remembers the difference between
an eel and a skate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mouth of fishes either opens from beneath, as in the
rays, or at the extremity of the muzzle, as in the great majority
of species, or from the upper surface, as in a small
foreign group called <span class='it'>Uranoscopus</span>, or moon-gazer—an odd
name for species, some of which have been alleged to bury
themselves to the depth of twenty feet in sand—a bed not
easily obtained, and in no way fitted for astronomical observation.
It also varies much in its relative dimensions,
from the minute perforation of the genus <span class='it'>Centriscus</span>, to the
vast expanded gape of the ugly angler-fish. We mean nothing
personal in the last allusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The teeth of fishes are frequently very numerous, and are
sometimes spread over all the bony parts of the interior
cavity of the mouth and pharynx, that is, on the maxillary,
inter-maxillary and palatal bones, on the vomer, tongue,
branchial arches, and pharyngeal bones. In certain genera
they exist on all those parts; while in others they are wanting
on some, or are even entirely absent on all. The denominations
of the teeth are derived from their position, that is from
the bones to which they are attached, and are consequently
as numerous as the varieties of their situation. In the upper
portion of the mouth of a trout, for example, there are five
rows of teeth. The single middle-row is placed upon the
central bone of the mouth called the <span class='it'>vomer</span>; a row on each
side of it is fixed on the right and left <span class='it'>palatal</span> bones, while
the outer-rows or those of the upper-jaw, properly so called,
are situate on the <span class='it'>maxillary</span> bones. In the under portion of
the mouth there are four rows, that is, one on each side of
the tongue, and another external to these on each side of the
lower-jaw. As to the form of teeth in fishes, the majority
are hooked and conical, and more or less acute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the majority of osseous fishes, besides the lips, which,
even when fleshy, having no peculiar muscles, can exert
but little strength in retaining the aliments, there is generally
in the inside of each jaw, behind the anterior teeth, a kind of
membranous fold or valvule, formed by a replication of the
interior skin, and directed backwards, of which the effect is
to hinder the alimentary substances, and especially the
water gulped during respiration, from escaping again by
the mouth. This structure does not, as formerly supposed,
constitute a character restricted to the genus <span class='it'>Zeus</span>, but exists
in an infinity of fishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The food seized by the teeth of the maxillæ, and detained
by the valve just mentioned, is carried still further backwards
by the teeth of the palate and tongue, when these exist, and
is at the same time prevented by the dentations of the branchial
arches from penetrating between the intervals of the
branchiæ, where it might injure those delicate organs of
respiration. The movements of the maxillæ and tongue
can thus send the food only in the direction of the pharynx,
where it undergoes additional action on the part of the teeth
of the pharyngeal bones, which triturate or carry it backwards
into the œsophagus. The last-named portion is
clothed by a layer of strong, close set, muscular fibres, sometimes
forming various bundles, the contractions of which
push the alimentary matter into the stomach—thus completing
the act of deglutition.</p>

<div><h1><a id='new'></a>REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS.</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>A Grammar of the English Language, in a series of Letters,
addressed to every American Youth. By</span> <span class='sc'>Hugh A.
Pue</span>. <span class='it'>Philadelphia: Published by the Author.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is the title of a queer little book, which its author regards
as “not only necessary, but urgently called for,” because
not only “the mass of the people are ignorant of
English Grammar, but because those who profess great
knowledge of it, and even those who make the teaching of it
their business, will be found, upon examination, to be very
far from understanding its principles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether Mr. P. proceeds upon the safe old plan of <span class='it'>Probe
meliora; deteriora sequer</span>—whether he is one of “the
mass,” and means to include himself among the ignoramuses—or
whether he is only a desperate quiz—we shall
not take it upon ourselves to say; but the fact is clear that,
in a Preface of less than two small duodecimo pages (the
leading object of which seems to be an eulogy upon one
William Cobbett), he has given us some half dozen distinct
instances of bad Grammar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For these purposes,” says he—that is to say—the purposes
of instructing mankind and enlightening “every American
youth” without exception—“for these purposes, I
have written my lessons in a series of letters. A mode that
affords more opportunity for plainness, familiarity, instruction,
and entertainment, than any other. A mode that was
adopted by Chesterfield, in his celebrated instructions on
politeness. A mode that was adopted by Smollett, in many
of his novels, which, even at this day, hold a distinguished
place in the world of fiction. A mode that was adopted by
William Cobbett, not only in his admirable treatise on English
Grammar, but in nearly every work that he wrote.”
“To Mr. Cobbett,” adds the instructor of every American
youth—“to Mr. Cobbett I acknowledge myself <span class='it'>indebted</span> for
the greater part of the grammatical knowledge which I possess.”
Of the fact stated there can be no question. Nobody
but Cobbett could have been the grammatical Mentor of Mr.
Pue, whose book (which is <span class='it'>all</span> Cobbett) speaks plainly upon
the point—nothing but the ghost of William Cobbett, looking
over the shoulder of Hugh A. Pue, could have inspired
the latter gentleman with the bright idea of stringing together
four consecutive sentences, in each of which the leading
nominative noun is destitute of a verb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Pue may attempt to justify his phraseology here, by
saying that the several sentences, quoted above, commencing
with the words, “A mode,” are merely continuations of the
one beginning “For these purposes;” but this is no justification
at all. By the use of the period, he has rendered each
sentence distinct, and each must be examined as such, in
respect to its grammar. We are only taking the liberty of
condemning Mr. P. by the words of his own mouth. Turning
to page 72, where he treats of punctuation, we read as
follows:—“The full point is used at the end of every complete
sentence; and a complete sentence is a collection of
words making a complete sense, without being dependent
upon another collection of words to convey the full meaning
intended.” Now, what kind of a meaning can we give to
such a sentence as “A mode that was adopted by Chesterfield
in his celebrated instructions on politeness,” if we are
to have “no dependence upon” the sentences that precede
it? But, even in the supposition that these five sentences
had been run into one, as they should have been, they
would still be ungrammatical. For example—“For these
purposes I have written my lessons in a series of letters—a
mode that affords more opportunity for plainness, familiarity,
instruction, and entertainment than any other—a
mode, etc.” This would have been the proper method of
punctuation. “A mode” is placed in apposition with “a
series of letters.” But it is evident that it is <span class='it'>not</span> the “series
of letters” which is the “mode.” It is <span class='it'>the writing the lessons</span>
in a series which is so. Yet, in order that the noun
“mode” can be properly placed in apposition with what
precedes it, this latter must be either a noun, or a sentence,
which, taken collectively, can serve as one. Thus, in any
shape, all that we have quoted is bad grammar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We say “<span class='it'>bad grammar</span>,” and say it through sheer obstinacy,
because Mr. Pue says we should not. “Why, what is
grammar?” asks he indignantly. “Nearly all grammarians
tell us that grammar is the writing and speaking of the English
language correctly. What then is bad grammar? Why
bad grammar must be the bad writing and speaking of the
English language correctly!!” We give the two admiration
notes and all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first place, if grammar be only the writing and
speaking the <span class='it'>English</span> language correctly, then the French,
or the Dutch, or the Kickapoos are miserable, ungrammatical
races of people, and have no hopes of being anything
else, unless Mr. Pue proceeds to their assistance:—but, let
us say nothing of this for the present. What we wish to
assert is, that the usual definition of grammar, as “the
writing and speaking <span class='it'>correctly</span>,” is an error which should
have been long ago exploded. Grammar is the analysis of
language, and this analysis will be <span class='it'>good</span> or <span class='it'>bad</span>, just as the
capacity employed upon it be weak or strong—just as the
grammarian be a Horne Tooke or a Hugh A. Pue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But perhaps, after all, we are treating this gentleman discourteously.
His book may be merely intended as a good
joke. By the bye, he says in his Preface, that “while he
informs the student, he shall take particular care to <span class='it'>entertain</span>
him.” Now, the truth is, we have been exceedingly
entertained. In such passages as the following, however,
which we find upon the second page of the Introduction, we
are really at a loss to determine whether it is the <span class='it'>utile</span> or the
<span class='it'>dulce</span> which prevails. We give the italics of Mr. Pue;
without which, indeed, the singular force and beauty of the
paragraph cannot be duly appreciated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>proper</span> study of English grammar, so far from being
<span class='it'>dry</span>, is one of the most rational enjoyments known to us;
one that is highly calculated to rouse the dormant energies
of the student; it requiring continual mental effort; unceasing
exercise of mind. It is, in fact, the <span class='it'>spreading of a
thought-producing plaster of paris upon the extensive
grounds of intellect</span>! It is the parent of idea, and great
causation of reflection; the mighty <span class='it'>instigator of insurrection
in the interior</span>; and, above all, the unflinching <span class='it'>champion
of internal improvement</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We know nothing about plaster of Paris; but the analogy
which subsists between ipecac and grammar—at least between
ipecac and the grammar of Mr. Pue—never, certainly,
struck us in so clear a point of view, as it does
now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, after all, whether Mr. P.’s queer little book shall or
shall not meet the views of “Every American Youth,” will
depend pretty much upon another question of high moment—whether
“Every American Youth” be or be not as great
a nincompoop as Mr. Pue.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Powhatan; a Metrical Romance, in Seven Cantos. By</span>
<span class='sc'>Seba Smith</span>. <span class='it'>New York: Harper and Brothers.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What few notices we have seen of this poem, speak of it as
the production of <span class='it'>Mrs.</span> Seba Smith. To be sure, gentlemen
may be behind the scenes, and know more about the matter
than we do. They may have some private reason for
understanding that black is white—some reason into which
we, personally, are not initiated. But, to ordinary perception,
“Powhatan” is the composition of Seba Smith, <span class='it'>Esquire</span>,
of Jack Downing memory, and <span class='it'>not</span> of his wife. <span class='it'>Seba Smith</span>
is the name upon the title-page; and the personal pronoun
which supplies the place of this well-known prænomen and
cognomen in the preface, is, we are constrained to say, of
the masculine gender. “The author of Powhatan,”—thus,
for example, runs a portion of the prolegomena—“does
not presume to claim for <span class='it'>his</span> production the merit of good
and genuine poetry, nor does <span class='it'>he</span> pretend to assign it a place
in the classes or forms into which poetry is divided”—in
all which, by the way, he is decidedly right. But can it be
that no gentleman has <span class='it'>read</span> even so far as the Preface of the
book? Can it be that the critics have had no curiosity to
creep into the <span class='it'>adyta</span>—into the inner mysteries of this temple?
If so, they are decidedly right too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Powhatan” is handsomely bound. Its printing is clear
beyond comparison. Its paper is magnificent, and we undertake
to say (for <span class='it'>we have</span> read it through with the greatest
attention) that there is not a single typographical error in it,
from one end to the other. Further than this, in the way of
commendation, no man with both brains and conscience
should proceed. In truth, a more absurdly <span class='it'>flat</span> affair—for
flat is the only epithet which applies in this case—was
never before paraded to the world, with so grotesque an air
of bombast and assumption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To give some idea of the <span class='it'>tout ensemble</span> of the book—we
have first a Dedication to the “Young People of the United
States,” in which Mr. Jack Downing lives, in “the hope that
he may do some good in his day and generation, by adding
something to the sources of rational enjoyment and <span class='it'>mental
culture</span>.” Next, we have a Preface, occupying four pages,
in which, quoting his publishers, the author tells us that
poetry is a “very great bore, and won’t sell”—a thing
which cannot be denied in certain cases, but which Mr.
Downing denies in his own. “It may be true,” he says,
“of endless masses of words, that are poured forth from the
press, under the <span class='it'>name</span> of poetry”—but it is not true “of
<span class='it'>genuine</span> poetry—of that which is worthy of the name”—in
short, we presume he means to say it is not in the least
little bit true of “Powhatan;” with regard to whose merits
he wishes to be tried, not by the critics (we fear, in fact,
that here it is the critics who will be tried), “but by the
<span class='it'>common</span> taste of <span class='it'>common</span> readers”—all which ideas are
common enough, to say no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have next, a “Sketch of the Character of Powhatan,”
which is exceedingly interesting and commendable, and
which is taken from Burk’s “History of Virginia:"—four
pages more. Then comes a <span class='it'>Poem</span>—four pages more—forty-eight
lines—twelve lines to a page—in which all that
we can understand, is something about the name of “Powhatan”</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>of the author—that is to say, of Jack Downing, Esquire.
We have now, one after the other, <span class='sc'>Cantos</span> one, two, three,
four, five, six, and seven—each subdivided into <span class='sc'>Parts</span>, by
means of Roman numerals—some of these <span class='sc'>Parts</span> comprehending
as many as six lines—upon the principle, we presume,
of packing up precious commodities in small bundles.
The volume then winds up with <span class='it'>Notes</span>, in proportion of
three to one, as regards the amount of text, and taken,
the most of them, from Burk’s Virginia, as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is very difficult to keep one’s countenance when reviewing
such a <span class='it'>work</span> as this; but we will do our best, for
the truth’s sake, and put on as serious a face as the case
will admit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leading fault of “Powhatan,” then, is precisely what
its author supposes to be its principal merit. “It would be
difficult,” he says, in that pitiable preface, in which he has
so exposed himself, “to find a poem that embodies more
truly the spirit of history, or indeed that follows out more
faithfully many of its details.” It would, indeed; and we are
very sorry to say it. The truth is, Mr. Downing has never
dreamed of any artistic <span class='it'>arrangement</span> of his facts. He has
gone straight forward, like a blind horse, and turned neither
to the one side nor to the other, for fear of stumbling. But
he gets them all in—every one of them—the facts we
mean. Powhatan never did anything in his life, we are sure,
that Mr. Downing has not got in his poem. He begins at the
beginning, and goes on steadily to the end—painting away
at his story, just as a sign-painter at a sign; beginning at
the left hand side of his board, and plastering through to the
right. But he has omitted one very ingenious trick of the
sign-painter. He has forgotten to write under his portrait—“<span class='it'>this
is a pig</span>,” and thus there is some danger of mistaking
it for an opossum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we are growing scurrilous, in spite of our promise,
and must put on a sober visage once more. It <span class='it'>is</span> a hard
thing, however, when we have to read and write about such
doggerel as this:</p>

could distinctly state the difference between an epic and an

book is a very <span class='it'>un</span>common book. We never saw any one
so uncommonly bad—nor one about whose parturition so

Downing; your “Metrical Romance” is not worth a single

sir Philip Sidney, upon the title-page? “He cometh to
you with a tale that holdeth children from play, and old
men from the chimney-corner.” What do you mean by it,
we say. Either you cannot intend to apply it to the “<span class='it'>tale</span>”
of Powhatan, or else all the “old men” in your particular
neighbourhood must be <span class='it'>very</span> old men; and all the “little

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Miscellanies of Literature. By the Author of Curiosities
of Literature. 3 vols. J. &amp; H. Langley, New York:
1841.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These volumes remind us of Coke upon Lyttleton, with
which whilom we were wont to be delighted; for they are
full of the same odd conceits, and present the same crude
mass of undigested learning. Facts which no one else
would ever have hunted up from the shelves of dusty libraries;
theories which hitherto no man thought of substantiating
by a reference to biography or history; ideas, which
are oddities in themselves, and which are presented in the
quaintest style; and illustrations of notions that no one else
would ever have thought of, or which, if thought of, would
not have been dressed up in so outlandish a manner, are
all marshalled together here in disorderly array, pushing,
jostling, and crowding each other until they remind one of
Falstaff’s valorous regiment, or a militia training in a midland
county.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seriously, however, these miscellanies embody a vast
amount of out-of-the-way intelligence, interesting to the
general, but absolutely necessary to the literary reader. No
man but D’Israeli would ever have had the patience to compile
such a work. His ideas on the literary character; his
observations on men of genius; and his sketch of King
James the first, embody a vast body of undigested facts that
must have consumed years merely in their collection. Industry,
however, is the only merit of these volumes: in
arranging this vast mass of truths, D’Israeli has shown anything
but a comprehensive mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work is got up in fine style, as what work is not,
when issued by the Langleys?</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Carleton, A Tale of Seventeen Hundred and Seventy-Six.
Two volumes. Philadelphia: Lea &amp; Blanchard.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We have heard this novel attributed to a gentleman of
Philadelphia, and also to a citizen of New York. The question
appears to be a moot one still, but, like many other
moot points, is one of amazingly little importance. The
book seems to be the composition of a young man, well educated
in consonance with some of those Pharisaical literary
creeds which are all-potent in deadening the higher powers
in favor of the common-place. He has been taught <span class='it'>propriety</span>
as the chief of the cardinal virtues, and instructed to
regard <span class='it'>originality</span> as the sum total of the cardinal sins. His
peculiar intellect, at the same time, has been a soil precisely
adapted for the seed sown. In regard to “Carleton,” we
may say in its behalf that its style is strikingly <span class='it'>correct</span>, and
that its incidents and its reflections never, even by accident,
startle us into unpleasant excitement. With this peace-offering
upon the shrine of the <span class='it'>decorous</span>, we now take the liberty
of throwing the book out of the window.</p>

With Anecdotes of their Courts; Now first Published
from Official Records and Other Authentic Documents,

London Edition, with Corrections and Additions. By</span>
<span class='sc'>Agnes Strickland</span>. <span class='it'>Vols. 1 and 2. Lea &amp; Blanchard.
Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This book has been well received in England, and justly
so. Its design is obviously good, and its execution does
honor to the fair author—for in this instance it is scarcely
right to call her a compiler. The work is quite as original
as any similar work can be. The task of composing it has
been an arduous one indeed; and there are few women who
could have accomplished it, as we see it accomplished. The
ground upon which Mrs. Strickland has so boldly yet judiciously
ventured is one hitherto unbroken, and, although
she has trodden among flowers, she has not escaped the
delving drudgery of the pioneer. In short, a deep research
has been demanded for this labor, in quarters far out of the
reach of the ordinary investigator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The title, although comprehensive, does not fully indicate
the book. We have not only the Lives of the Queens from
the Norman Conquest, but, in the Introduction, notices of
the ancient British and Saxon ones. The Empress Matilda
is included among the former; although she has never been
so ranked by any previous historian. In this our author is
fully justified, however; for Matilda, who herself claimed
no title beyond that of “Domina of England,” was queen <span class='it'>de
jure</span>, and, in a historical view, a monarch of high importance,
as the mother of the Plantagenets, and the uniting
link of the Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman dynasties. The
materials of which her memoir is composed are derived
chiefly from Norman and Latin chronicles, never before
translated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These volumes are sufficiently well done in a mechanical
point of view. The lithograph portrait of Matilda, however,
is greasy and ineffective, and typographical blunders obscure
the meaning of many important passages. In the very first
paragraph of the Introduction, for instance, we have Solent
<span class='it'>fæminrum</span> ductu bellare; a sentence which we are quite
sure was never put together by Tacitus, from whose Life of
Agricola it is taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The book, upon the whole, is one of rich interest and
value, and must find a place in every historical library.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This novel displays considerable ability, wasted on very
common-place incidents. If the author will undertake a
subject worthy of her talents—are we wrong in fancying the
writer a lady?—we may yet hail her as a novelist of no

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Preface of this little work greatly interested us in its
favor, and a careful examination of its contents did not
lessen the interest. In its arrangement, Geography and History
are combined—the former being the leading topic, and
the latter the concomitant. The author’s observations, in
respect to this junction, are just. The two subjects are so
intimately connected in their own nature, that, however
they may be separated in books, they can never be disconnected
in the mind. The simultaneous study of both, properly
connected, secures the learner from imbibing false notions
of either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The book is concise, but accurate, and well adapted either
for a prefatory text-book, or for those whose limited school-time
will not allow them to go through with a more diffuse
system. It is very neatly and substantially gotten up.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Works of Lord Bolingbroke, with a Life, prepared
expressly for this Edition, containing additional information
relative to his Personal and Private Character:
4 vols. Carey and Hart: Philadelphia. 1841.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An American edition of the works of Lord Bolingbroke
has long been a <span class='it'>desideratum</span> to the scholar, and it is with
no little pride we record that to Philadelphia we are indebted
for so elegant an edition of them, as now lies before us.
The typography of these volumes would do credit to the
famous London press. With the exception of a few costly
works published from time to time in our country, this edition
of Lord Bolingbroke is unrivalled as a work of art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The volumes before us contain the various political and
philosophical writings of Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke.
Of these, the political tracts are the most valuable:
in a measure, for their matter, but chiefly for their style.
Among these, the “Dissertation on Parties,” the “Letter to
Sir Wm. Wyndham,” the “Idea of a Patriot King,” and the
letters “on the study of History,” are the most celebrated.
The philosophical essays, occupying two of the volumes on
our table, are comparatively valueless, and inferior, both in
style and matter, to the political tracts. They are deeply
imbued with the sceptical opinions of the author, and we
should have willingly seen them omitted in this edition, if it
were possible to get up a complete one, with nearly one
half of the author’s works left out. Little, therefore, as we
value the philosophical works of Bolingbroke, we commend
the publishers for not expunging them as too many
others would have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The style of Bolingbroke is unrivalled. No library is perfect
without his works, and they should be studied by the
public speaker, or the author, night and day. We boldly
aver that there does not exist a writer in the language, the
reading of whose works, so far as diction is concerned,
would be more beneficial to young men. Bolingbroke’s
choice of words is singularly fine. Nothing can be clearer,
stronger, or more copious than his language. Terse, nervous,
epigrammatic; diffuse in general, but condensed when
necessary; at times racy, at times vehement, at times compact
as iron; rhetorical, yet easy; elegant, yet convincing;
bold, rapid and declamatory, his writings carry one away
like a spoken harangue, without betraying the carelessness
of the extemporaneous style. The very absence of method,
which, in others, would be faulty, is, in Bolingbroke, from
the air of frankness it gives to his cause, and its consistency
with his essentially oratorical style, a merit: at least not a
defect. In grace he has no equal. The euphony of his sentences
is like the liquid flow of a river. No writer in the
English tongue so much resembles Cicero—to our mind—as
Bolingbroke. Burke has been called his rival here; but
Burke wanted the ease, the elegance, the chastened imagery
of Tully, and in all of these St. John rivalled the friend of
Atticus. Deeply imbued with the Latin literature, Bolingbroke
has caught, as it were, the spirit of the Augustan age;
and we feel, in perusing his pages, the same chastened delight
which we enjoy over no modern, and only over Tully
among the ancients.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We repeat it: no library is complete without these volumes.
Hitherto, the difficulty of obtaining a set of Bolingbroke’s
Works, and the high price at which the English
editions were sold, have confined the study of his writings
comparatively to a few.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The life of Bolingbroke, affixed to these volumes, is altogether
a mongrel affair, being made up of shreds and patches,
like an old grandam’s best bed-quilt. The text is Goldsmith,
interpolated with Brougham, Cooke, and the Encyclopædia.
It is true, the preface states this at large, but it also
conveys the impression that the memoir has been re-written,
and that only the <span class='it'>materials</span> have been used. Now, if so,
a more unequal, ragged, piebald piece of composition was
never perpetrated than this same memoir, and the author—if
any one but a pair of scissors there be—ought to be condemned
to the now obsolete, but not less effective punishment,
of the cutty-stool. If ever a man deserved a horse-pond,
it is the inditer of this biography.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is scarcely too much to say that the Temperance Reformation
is the most important which the world ever
knew. Yet its <span class='it'>great</span> feature has never yet been made a subject
of comment. We mean that of adding to man’s happiness
(the ultimate object of <span class='it'>all</span> reform), not by the difficult
and equivocal process of multiplying his pleasures, in their
external regard, but by the simple and most effectual one of
exalting his capacity for enjoyment. The temperate man
carries within his own bosom, under all circumstances, the
true, the only elements of bliss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The book before us will essentially aid the good cause.
The memoir of Mathew is deeply interesting; but, excellent
as it is, we prefer the essay of Dr. Morris on “the Effects of
Drunkenness Physiologically considered.” Through the influence
of the physical, rather than of the moral suggestions
against alcohol, the permanency of the temperance reform
will be made good. Convince the world that spirituous
liquors are poison to the body, and it will be scarcely necessary
to add that they are ruin to the soul.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
